To be fair I can understand why they think that way, with the packaging showing pigs, frisking amoungst the daisies.|n
For example, recently it came out that hen's in certain types of 'free range' enviroments are actually worse off than battery hens.|n
They are packed into sheds just within the legal minimum to be called free range, it is not enough room for them to roam healthily and they become stressed and attack one another.|n
Organic food is grown without artificial chemicals and buying it is beneficial for two main reasons.|p
Number one is that you are not slowly poisoning yourself and the people you are serving (which if they are small children - are much more sensitive to these things and it is probably more likely to affect their development).|p
you are not deliberately putting toxins in their mouths that their body should not be exposed to for optimal health.|p
The second reason is that you are voting organic.|p
Every purchase is a vote for what should be on the market.|p
So, this is more of a question regarding whether or not you personally think it is worth it not to consume toxins and support better agriculture methods.|p
If you do, then spend the money if you have it.|0
Buying good food should be seen as a priority not a luxury... it is an apple not a thousand dollar handbag.|p
I think that yours is an excellent question, and I think the answer, if there is one, depends on which angle you look at.|0
I believe that organic farming methods are, without question, better for the environment, the soil, and the people (often poor) who harvest the crops.|p
People generally don’t buy Organic Food because of two reasons: High Cost Trust for the Organic Brand for which high price is paid.|n
Let me tell you first why Organic Food is expensive?|0
Organic food supply is limited as compared to demand; Production costs for organic foods are typically higher because of greater labour inputs per unit of output Post-harvest handling of relatively small quantities of organic foods results in higher costs because of the mandatory segregation of organic and conventional produce, especially for processing and transportation; Marketing and the distribution chain for organic products is relatively inefficient and costs are higher because of relatively small volumes.|0
In order to trust the Organic Brand you should check the norms (international and national)- like NPOP, USDA, etc - which have set the standards and which conform to these guidelines and certify producers.|0
The company which you can trust for Organic produce is 24 Mantra.|p
We are working with close to 25,000 farmers covering almost 150,,000 acres of agricultural land across 15 States.|p

it is really expensive.|n
Companies selling the largest volume of organics are Wal-Mart, Costco, Kroger, Target, Safeway, and Whole Foods.|0
Companies are in business to make money, not dispense goodness, so by their own standard, the best is Whole Foods with 36% overall gross profit percent versus 28% for others.|p
I dislike Whole Foods because it fosters the idea that healthy food costs too much.|p
My picks for best are Trader Joe and HEB (TX).|p
While, as already metioned, that eating organic products usually prevent or at least deminish your intake of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics etc.|p
Another good reason for eating organic foods is for ethical reasons.|p
Many vegitarians and vegans could probably list many books and websites that explain and show all the horrific things that take place in these factories(these places are not farms) that mass produce beef, pork, chicken etc., but I am neither and will just compare it will organic animal husbandry practices.|0
Organic farming on the other hand, treats it is animals and treats nature with more consideration.|p
Nature does not get hit and damaged by the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilisers in the same way.|p
The animals are treated better considering feed, space to roam(often outside, they do not spend their whole life in cages without even seeing the sky), and companionship(by this I mean that the animals often stay with their mothers longer and live of her milk.|p
This has a lot of benifits regarding the creatures health).|p
Here's the tip offs: Conventional celery is much larger and paler than organically grown.|0
Organic celery is a nice deep (almost electric) Green because it is gotten lots of sun which stimulates chlorophyll growth, and thus the flavor you and I like.|0
Also, the opposite of “organic” in the context it is typically used is “conventional”, not “GMO”.|0
As to your question, no, there are not significant difference in the environmental impacts of typical organic foods versus most conventional foods, or most GM foods.|n
They are all often both equally destructive of soil, and all can equally end up with excess amounts of harmful chemicals accumulating in the environment (whether “organic” or not).|n
With organic production, it is possible a similar effect could occur, though differing practices might limit the severity as well.|n
With organic production, it is possible a similar effect could occur, though differing practices might limit the severity as well.|p
I buy (mostly) organic because I want to (1) increase animal welfare (there are stricter regulations for the treatment of the animals in the Danish equivalent of “organic”) and (2) to avoid spreading pesticides, certain types of fertilizers, overuse of antibiotics, etc.|p
The advertising and reasons I could gather that most people bought organic was because they thought it was better for them.|p
I’m not saying one person can’t have several valid reasons for doing something, but I did not once hear anyone talk about anything than the personal benefits for them.|0
I would say that while this is not perfect, they are worth the extra price.|p
But that is based on a view where I am taking a more holistic approach.|p
If you are only interested in the health benefits for you, then it really depends, and is not something that can be answered without a LOT of additional information.|0
The information I already asked about, but also things like how much money a certain increase in “health” (and what aspects of “health” you are talking about; “health” is a lot of different things all working together) is worth to you.|0
Very (VERY) simplistically, would one less sick day per lifetime and one more day alive be worth $1,000,000,000,000?|0
A relatively recent meta study (a study aggregating the results of several different studies) found no benefit: Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds . |0
Organic food is largely a marketing scam.|n
There is decent evidence to suggest it is no better for your health and actually worse for the environment.|0
There is decent evidence to suggest it is no better for your health and actually worse for the environment.|n
"While there may be individual examples of organic farms using the very best practices where the output per acre is higher, if you look at the category of foods labeled USDA organic overall they are an average of 25% less productive based off of a meta analysis of many many different studies (<URL>"" I have nothing against the best practices, but honestly those need not be restricted to Organic."|0
"Indeed one leading plant genetic engineer strongly believes we should combine the best of both organic/traditional farming and genetic modification to meet the worlds food demands and lower our environmental impact ( <URL>"" )."|0
Additionally, a very large meta study conducted at Stanford found no health benefits to organic food.|0
Likewise, places like Whole foods benifit greatly by misleading consumers into thinking their produce is somehow safer and better for the environment and thus can charge MUCH higher prices for foods that are basically identical.|0

I basically see organic labels and non-GMO labels as a way to do this.|n
But local and organic food are not synonymous.|0
Likewise I can get food labelled organic that is flown in from across the world.|0
Overall on the the biggest problems I have with the 'Organic' label though is that it is misleading.|n
I bet you there are some organic farms that are superior to conventional but I would argue they are the minority.|0
I have no issue with environmentally friendlier agricultural practices, I just argue that the USDA organic label really does not represent those.|n

The foods are proven no more safe and overall are likely worse for the environment.|n
"I truly believe that the majority of ""organic"" produce sold in super markets is all about marketing and is misleading to the consumers."|n
I just want you to know I am not attacking your point on better farming practices, but just specifically the idea that organic food you buy at the super market is better than conventional.|n
But again, this is not about organic but rather about heirloom foods (organic does not mean heirloom varieties).|0
"First of all, ""Organic"" is a widely used term that is often loosely applied to signify ""clean"", ""natural"" or ""free of synthesized ingredients""."|0
"It kinda means, ""less affected by the hand of industry"" Conceptually, there is a lot of grey area and the word probably suffers from misuse by anyones' definition."|0
Organic food is, more clearly, food grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers.|p
"would mean ""Certified Organic"" under some public authority.. To be certified it would be cultivated under certain rules and perhap from an inspected farm."|0
Approved natural pesticides can used and fertizers are usually sourced from plants and animals.|p
Organic food is actively planted and managed using methods adapted to the plant and the local environment.|p
So, while wild berries that you pick might happen to be organic (or they might not, if they come from a ditch along a conventional sprayed farm!|0
And Certified Organic is farmed, planted, not wild.|0
"And then there are families or companies whose property is legally Certified Organic and they can sell a certified organic Main Wild Blueberry that you could also say was ""Wildcrafted"""|0
A large majority of cows (in the US anyway) are fed corn at some point if not at all points of their life.|p
What I am saying is that it really does not matter what scale of organic farming we are talking cows are likely to be eating at least some corn.|n
Its considerably more profitable to grow than many other crops even if under organic management you can only grow it in the rotation every 2-4 years on a field at best.|n
Equipment for handling corn is readily available in most agricultural areas meaning farmers do not have to buy special equipment to plant, tend or harvest it and can easily share with neighbors.|0
Can you plant a pasture mix that combines all those nutrients important for cow's microbes that would be a complete feed needing no supplemental corn?|n
Yes, but it is not always the easiest thing to do for a host of reasons.|n
Organic foods refer to food items that are grown without the use of chemicals, fertilizers or any unnatural interference.|0
Organic foods refer to all food products that are allowed to grow in their natural surroundings without any human interference or genetic modifications.|0
I have been shopping at WF for over 15 years for 2 essential reasons: 1) Taste: Fruits, for example, taste quite a bit better than the ones you will find in other supermarkets.|p
I assume so, because the food tastes better there, it is marked as organic, and emphasis is put on high quality products from responsible farmers.|p
(or, at least, they have been very good at reinforcing this belief in me via their in-store marketing efforts) what is more, I also perceive that purchasing products from a big company like Whole Foods is potentially less risky from a health standpoint than going to a local farmer's market...|p

"""Natural"" or ""organic"" pesticides (organic growers all use pesticides, they just use organic ones) can be just as safe/harmless as synthetic ones."|0
They can also just as dangerous , and they can sometimes be much, much worse !|n
Whether the pesticide was organic or not would not matter.|0
Third, if the organic chemical is weaker, it will be applied in a higher dose and more frequently.|0
Last, several cases exist where organic pesticides are worse than synthetics.|n
The organic equivalent, that also leaves no residues and is equally effective as an herbicide, is Pharm Solutions Weed Pharm, made of 20% acetic acid (concentrated vinegar).|0
It is corrosive, can cause permanent eye damage, causes skin sensitization, and is FATAL if swallowed or absorbed through the skin.|n
For the farmer, it means they must use goggles and protective clothing when using the organic herbicide, but can use roundup naked if they so choose.|n
Evidence shows that people who eat organic food have no health benefits compared to conventional agriculture food: they are neither healthier nor less sick, but do spend more.|n
"If you are a grower, look at the labels on the pesticide and decide for yourself if it is toxic or not, but pay no heed to buzzwords like ""natural,"" ""organic,"" or ""synthetic"" that have no bearing on safety of efficacy, period."|0
I eat an almost 100% organic food diet and I am reasonably certain that I have benefited from it but I still cannot give an unqualified yes to this question.|p
There are several problems with organic standards and certification.|n
Organic food used to be produced by small-scale farmers who grew incredibly high quality produce without using any toxic chemicals.|0
In the last 15 years that has changed and organics is now largely out of control of farmers and firmly in the hands of the certifying bodies (such as the USDA in america) and the huge companies that have largely taken over the organic food market.|0
Here is a bit of a catch up on the current state of the union when it comes to organic food.|0
First The Bad News 1.|n
In many cases organic certification represents a minimum standard that farmers (and big-agriculture companies) use as a checklist in order to put an official stamp on their product and then command a higher price for food that is not much different to conventional produce.|n
Their products meet the letter of the law but not the spirit of it.|n
The USDA published their guidelines for organic certification in 2000 and Horizon (along with many other huge food operations) saw massive profits to be made and switched their cows to organic feed, stopped giving them hormones and hey presto they were now organic certified.|0
The problem was that they were a massive feedlot operation and were only barely meeting minimum standards to be certified.|n
* Their cows had the absolute minimum access to pasture and were just being shoveled massive piles of organic corn feed rather than conventional corn feed.|n
They were now on an even playing field on store shelves with more legitimate companies like Organic Valley which was a co-operative of smaller farms that were operated much more like what we all imagine an organic dairy farm to look like.|0
I could give countless other examples of companies that did similar things such as Cascadian farms, and the Hain Celestial group.|0
If you live in the USA you can walk in to a Sam's Club or a Wal-Mart and see huge tubs of store-brand, organic produce that is often farmed in China on massive farms that spray organic fertilizers, use organic certified pesticides, and pay low wages that would be illegal in the USA.|n
The distinction between some of the organic and conventional foods on these store-shelves is going to be superficial at best.|n
Organic Standards are massively different in different countries.|0
Behind the scenes there is constant jockeying by pesticide and fertilizer companies to get their products listed as certified organic.|n
There are pesticides that you can spray on your crops in the USA and still get your certified label that would cause you to lose your certification in Australia and vice versa.|n
Other farming practices suffer from the same arbitrariness between nations.|0
Multibillion-dollar companies are now heavily invested in organic foods.|0
These include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Whole Foods, and The Coca-Cola Company amongst many others.|0
As a result of being stakeholders in organic standards they lobby the certifying bodies whenever organic standards come under periodic review.|0
In many cases these companies have campaigned to weaken organic standards and allow conventional farming practices to creep into their operations and still get the all-important organic label.|0
It is not that these companies are evil it is just that organic farming is inherently more costly than conventional farming.|0
Their economic incentives are to try to reduce the costs of organic farming while still commanding the higher price that an organic label will get them.|0
The Good News It is possible to eat food that is organic in the old sense of the word, grown by farmers who have integrity and seek to grow food without spraying them with horrible poisons.|p
** You have to do your research though and look at organic certification as the baseline minimum standard rather than the final word on food safety.|0
As Evita Ochel points out there is solid research showing benefits from eating organic foods despite all these compromises that have been made to organic standards.|p
If you have farmer's markets in your area I highly recommend going to them and getting to know farmers in your area.|0
Ask them if they actually grow the food they are selling or if they are a reseller.|0
Ask them if they grow organically.|0
Check out Food Babe who for all the controversy surrounding her is one of the most effective campaigners to hold companies' feet to the fire in terms of food safety.|0
You may or may not agree with everything she says but her guides are a good start to educating yourself about food ingredients.|0
Footnotes: * Horizon has since then cleaned up their act significantly and USDA organic standards have gotten tougher on feedlot operations that try to get organic certified.|p
Avoiding this one chemical is reason enough to eat organic.|p
it is illegal to say its organic if it isn't.|0
there is a lot of organic stuff round now, and supermarkets will clearly label those items.|p
Look for the word organic.|0
If you are staying for a while or emigrating here, consider using an organic box scheme.|0
This is a cheaper way of buying organic.|p
If you are holidaying, look for either the COOP or Waitrose supermarkets for the largest organic and fair trade variety.|0
Fair trade is partly organic too by the way, as it bans certain nasty pesticides etc, just not as many, and also has high animal welfare standards.|0
Fair trade is partly organic too by the way, as it bans certain nasty pesticides etc, just not as many, and also has high animal welfare standards.|p
Ps you can google for organic pubs and restaurants too!|0
The answer to your specific question is no, there has not been a noticeable impact yet.|n
I do not see it, for the simple reason that most people are still accepting marketing initiatives as their primary source of nutrition education.|n
Marketing exists to make money for shareholders, not to benefit people.|n
"For this reason, consumers accept that a product is ""organic"", ""natural"" and so forth because a label says so, without regard for what those terms mean in the legal context, in the context of the FDA and USDA, or what *other* ingredients are in the box."|n
In other words, people are not yet eating food the way Earth delivers it to us.|0
Yes, yes, and more yes!|p
In addition to the wonderful points in the answer made by Michele Trainer , there has been increasing research over the past few years especially shedding light on the importance of eating organic.|p
"Here is one example that examined many studies: Page on ncl.ac.uk “We carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods” Other research and a simple example is available in the book ""Toxin Toxout"" by Lourie and Smith, whose simple experiment demonstrated how much pesticide levels fell in children's bodies when eating solely organic, and how much they rose again when given conventional food."|p
When in doubt about organics, we simply need to ask ourselves: does it feel/seem right to eat food that has been naturally grown or chemically grown?|p
For me, the answer is simple and clear.|p
In fact organics have inspired me to grow some of my own food, as the differences in flavor alone are huge and so worth it!|p
And when we start thinking a little more globally, and consider the effects of eating organic on more than just ourselves, then we find that many more reasons to go organic.|p
Anyways there are no difference when it comes to the plant itself.|n
One thing though, in the hopes of justifying their price, 'organic' farms try to harvest their products later than conventional farms, meaning the fruit can be tastier than an early harvest.|0
The harvest conditions are possible as 'organic' farms are usually much smaller in scale, allowing the farmer to harvest just so and shipped off.|0
"""Organic food"" IS the normal condition!"|0
"""Organic"" is of course a marketing term, as mentioned by Craig."|n
What I’m talking about is actual organic grown vegetables grown on an actual field you can walk over in under an hour and without getting all sorts of cancer.|p
Craig, I have been eating organic vegan food for decades.|0
At 61, I am healthier than many (if not most) people half my age.|p
it is not about fear of modernity, it is about love for the planet and all the species who call it home (although I would rather live without bedbugs).|p
Organic is a concept, hijacked to increase prices and gain marketing advantage.|n
- Most corporations (like Monsanto and most others) distort data and flat out lie to make more profit.|n
Claims are to be taken with a bag of salt.|n
Some even invent their own certifier to con you with a shiny logo (Supermarket own brands are prone to this).|n
As Johnathan Law says, cross pollination is also a major issue.|n
Many apple and pear varieties are the result of orchardists fiddling, grafting etc.|n
Roses - Modified.|n
When the caveman only had organic food he lived a shorter life - Perhaps some chemicals and GMO's make us live longer?|n
Organic food is far more likely to be higher quality in nutrition and taste.|p
Also organic food is far more likely to be sustainable to the environment.|p
Sometimes it can even be regenerative.|p
Is Organic More Nutritious?|0
USDA But you need to be intelligent about it.|0
Organic certification does not guarantee any of these things.|n
Doubly ironic because the original purpose of the certification boards was to prevent industrial growers from fraudulently labeling food as organic that really wasn’t grown organically.|n
Many organic, local, high quality, healthy options.|p
Save mart, key foods market, piggly wiggly, local organic stores!|0
Before I go into subject, let me tell you Agri Gold financial scam in AP, India Agri gold collects one time deposit or recurring deposits and issue a document that they will register a piece of land after some specified time or money will be returned with interest.|n
Same is happening in organic stores Organic stores in India do not source their items locally.|n
If you are in AP, they source it from Kerala, Uttarakhand etc Objective is to confuse consumer with fantastic organic labels.|n
None of the natural farmers around the city supply to these organic stores because price offered is less than 30% of consumer price.|n
This is the reason for not increasing of natural farmers number even though demand of organic food increasing at high rate Unless you know the source of food, its difficult to say based on our five senses as modern technology invented some chemical to trick these five senses.|n
Page on jacobinmag.com What comes to being duped by conventional food - we are not 'duped' what comes to health benefits of food, although this is a popular narrative told by many, often people who want to sell you some kind of an alternative product.|n
'Organic' in food context is a marketing label construct that creates a commercial advantage in sales compared to what is called conventionally farmed food (99 % of farming in the US).|0
Organic food certainly does not solve any health risks of food, although their marketing may imply otherwise, and that you could call being duped.|n
Several comprehensive reviews support the view that there are no nutritional or health benefits from organic products.|n
I lay them out in this piece: Organic vs conventional food The summary: It must be reasonable to assume, that should there be a stable measurable difference in the nutritional content of organic food, other reviews would be able to arrive at that conclusion independently of each other.|n
Instead, we have four reviews on similar lines - finding no nutritional or health benefits of organic food.|n
Then we have one study stating a different conclusion, but at a closer look demonstrating very little differences for a few nutrients, likely at a level of no consequence for our health or nutrient intake.|n
When you talk about fruits and vegetables, most of the genetic enhancement and modification is done to improve taste and in this case organic foods do not taste better.|n
However, there is something a bit generic and bland about enhanced fruits and vegetables and something inherently original about their organic variants.|0
Animals who have lived their natural lives happy and in the open while eating their natural diet will always taste better than mass produced enhanced animals.|p
Organic fruits and vegetables are a lot healthier and have gained a lot of popularity in recent times.|p
Organic food is often fresher . |p
Fresh food tastes better.|p
Organic food is usually fresher because it doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer.|p
Organic produce is often (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms near where it is sold.|0
Organic farming is better for the environment.|p
Organic farming practices reduce pollution (air, water, soil), conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy.|p
Farming without pesticides is also better for nearby birds and small animals as well as people who live close to or work on farms.|p
Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts . |p
In addition, the animals are given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, both of which help to keep the animals healthy.|p
Organic food is GMO-free . |0
In most countries, organic crops contain no GMOs and organic meat comes from animals raised on organic, GMO-free feed.|p
The European Union funded study found that organic fruit and vegetables have up to 50% more antioxidants, which scientists believe can cut the risk of cancer and heart disease.|p
They have also more vitamins and minerals such as iron and zinc.|p
The taste of organic fruits and vegetables is often superior to any conventional produce.|p
that is why many top restaurants use organic produce in their menu.|p
However, the taste of fresh organic fruits is irresistible!|p
The advantages of organic foods might be highest for babies.|p
By feeding your child organic food, it will have about 1/6th the amount of carcinogens in its blood.|p
Thus you will decrease the chances of illnesses significantly.|p
Therefore, especially for infants and children a raw organic food diet is incredibly important.|p
All organic produce are nutritionally equal in terms of vitamin profiles.|0
As in, organic produce is at a higher baseline toxicity (seeds are bred that way).|n
Yes, this is the same in the other plants, but organics start out at that higher level, skyrocketing final readings.|0
That means that organics are on the magnitude of 1,000 to 1,000,000 times more toxic.|n
EVen with natural pesticides, organics are not fully protected and spend a lot of their valuable time making more self-defense toxins.|0
The variations between organic and traditional foods stem directly from the farming ways that were used throughout the food’s production.|0
Agriculture includes a direct result on the environment, therefore understanding what goes into our agriculture is vital.|0
Below may be a list of a number of the key variations between organic and traditional farming.|0
Organic farming works to extend property, variety, and to encourage sensible soil and air quality.|p
Organic Farming Organic farming minimizes chemical usage Organic farming promotes variety Soil health is improved with organic farming practices solely natural ways square measure employed in organic farming Conventional Farming typical farming makes use of chemicals, synthetics, and different materials to manage weeds and pests typical farming uses unnatural farming ways typical farming use of pesticides has garnered attention towards acceptable levels of toxicity, and whether or not there ought to truly be a suitable level Pesticides employed in typical farming is damaging to your health.|p
There square measure several different variations between organic and traditional farming, however these appear to be the foremost spoken of with regard to client health.|0
There are arguments around whether or not or not typical farming ways square measure safe for one’s health.|0
Theoretically, we have enough land area to grow organic food to feed entire global population.|p
I cannot find any data to check if we have enough natural resources everywhere to sustain organic farming at the level of conventional farming.|0
I do not think there is enough nutrient-rich top soil required for organic farming in existing pieces of agricultural land.|n
The main limitation so far is that, overall, organic yields have been considerably lower than conventional yields . |n
Which means, we will have to destroy more fertile land (e.g., forests) to increase the output of organic food to match conventionally-grown food.|n
Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture In order to grow organic food with high yields, farmers have to follow best agricultural management practices to make efficient use of local natural resources.|n
That requires a lot more smart planning compared to conventional farming.|n
I do not think farmers all over the world have the education, training, or motivation to do that kind of planning.|n
they will need constant guidance from specialists in agricultural resource management.|0
Will Organic Food Fail to Feed the World?|n
In fact, more knowledge would be key to any effort to boost organic farming or its yields.|p
Organic farmers, on the other hand, must learn to manage an entire ecosystem geared to producing food—controlling pests through biological means, using the waste from animals to fertilize fields and even growing one crop amidst another.|0
"""Organic farming is a very knowledge-intensive farming system,"" Seufert notes."|n
"An organic farmer ""needs to create a fertile soil that provides sufficient nutrients at the right time when the crops need them."|0
Feeding everyone on this planet (i.e.,food security) is entirely different challenge though.|n
Can organic farmers produce enough food for everybody?|n
Food security is not only a question of the ability to produce food, but also of the ability to access food.|0
Global food production is more than enough to feed the global population, the problem is getting it to the people who need it.|0
Organic agriculture and food security.|0
Still, many questions are asked with regards to the ability of organic agriculture to provide food - and many speculations are made, without any comprehensive data basis.|0
More thoughts about this question here Can Organic Farming Feed Us All?|n
He has more knowledge about agriculture than me.|0
Fresh foods are basically non-storable.|n
Price totally depends on current supply level on the market, and whatever super-food fad is circulating amongst consumers.|0
If difference is higher than 50%, consumers start to veer.|n
So you need to find your own local ways of using organic principles for cost reduction by using free materials available to you locally.|0
For veggies you need min.|p
For annual stuff you need 200–400% gross to make it worthwhile waiting and tieing land for 12 months to grow them.|n
It is good that you are thinking business right from start, though.|0
Other answers have very well explained why organic produce is costly in general.|p
But, most of the cultivable land in India is by default organic.|p
That means the cultivable land is not exposed to pesticides or fertilizers at all, like North eastern parts of India, where farmers do not have access to chemical solutions.|p
Moreover, Farmers have to pay nearly Rs.10,000 ($200) for a certification process in India and it may take upto 5 years to convert the soil for the full fledged organic crops production.|p
In short, organic farming uses bio fertilizers and costly methods for pest control like biological control agents.|p
But, Why is it so expensive in India?|0
India may account for 1 - 2% of the total organic produce worldwide.|0
One of the main reason for organic products so expensive in India , is that the local market is not the target market for the organic farmers in India . |0
Because, India exports 85% of its organic produce . |0
"Organic farmers in India eye the global market rather than the local market. """|0
"Around 60 per cent of the country’s organic products were exported to the European Union, 20 per cent to the US, 5 per cent to Japan and the rest to Canada, Australia and East Asian countries. """|0
Few years ago, I read that organic tender coconut was priced at Rs.200 ($5 then), in an export market.|0
Can we afford Rs.200 for an organic tender coconut?|n
I would have bought 20 tender coconuts for the same price instead.|n
So I would say, the price factor for Indian organic produce is highly influenced by the lucrative global market, rather than anything else.|0

If more and more people switch to organic farming then price might come down coz of the lower demand which will lead to abandoning organic farming again.|0
Only way is for the people to get used to the slightly higher price of the organic produce.. Also some people charge more than adequate for organic stuff because of the increasing demand and lower supply.. Hope things change for good..|n
If you buy organic food, you at least reduce the overall amount of chemicals in your blood.|p
So, this food is healthier.|p
Some of the copper salts they use in organic crops to spray against insects may also accumulate in your body, but not as much as if you paid no attention to food quality.|0
Some people have decided not to be part of this mass experiment and rather buy organic foods.|p
Because organic food production is an inefficient way of cultivating crops because it yields pathetic outputs in relation to the amount of inputs (labor, land, ect) gone into it.|n
We also like to purchase products that we have a connection to -- we always get great turnout when we have products that come in directly from customers -- that is true whether they are conventional, GMO or organic.|p
Recent studies are backing up what many thought: organic foods do indeed have a healthier nutritional profile than their conventional counterparts.|p
And they’re also lower in pesticide residues.|p
Eating organic fruits and vegetables could increase your antioxidant intake by 20-40%.|p
Organic strawberries have more nutrients and antioxidants than their conventional counterparts.|p
Organic tomatoes are 50% higher in vitamin C content than conventional tomatoes.|p
There are natural plant based harmless to human being, alternatives for Chemical fertilizers and Chemical pesticides - using those one can still achieve the agricultural yields as that of Chemical farming.|p
Particularly the big packaged food industry still wants to call the packaged food products with chemical preservatives as Organic.|n
Organic is a term that certifies an agricultural standard, intended to be free from antibiotics, herbicides and pesticides.|0
Ecocert are *not*, and many products certified by Ecocert have been shown to contain various herbicides and pesticides.|n
Organic whole foods certainly will not do the harm processed foods with lots of chemicals and preservatives and growth hormones and antibiotics do to you.|n
Then again, organic sugar, pasta, potatoes, rice, wheat products and corn are also not good for you as they can cause you to become addicted to sugar in its many forms and can lead to over-eating and obesity.|n
Kalgudi - Helping everyone across the globe with agricultural information You might think organic food would cost less than conventional food since the production is spared the cost of the chemicals, synthetic pesticides, and antibiotics.|0
Yet organic products typically cost 20 percent to 100 percent more than their conventionally produced equivalents.|n
Here are the top factors contributing to the high price of organic food 1.|n
Without them, organic farmers have to hire more workers for tasks like hand-weeding, cleanup of polluted water, and the remediation of pesticide contamination.|0
Demand overwhelms supply Organic farmland only accounts for 0.9 percent of total worldwide farmland, and organic farms tend to produce less than conventional farms.|n
Higher cost of fertilizer for organic crops Sewage sludge and chemical fertilizers might not be something you want in your food, but conventional farmers use them because they don’t cost much and are cheap to transport.|n
Organic farmers eschew these inexpensive solutions in order to keep their crops natural and instead use compost and animal manure, which is more expensive to ship.|n
Crop rotation Instead of using chemical weed-killers, organic farmers conduct sophisticated crop rotations to keep their soil healthy and prevent weed growth.|p
"After harvesting a crop, an organic farmer may use that area to grow ""cover crops,"" which add nitrogen to the soil to benefit succeeding crops."|p
Post-harvest handling cost In order to avoid cross-contamination, organic produce must be separated from conventional produce after being harvested.|0
Organic crops, however, are handled and shipped in smaller quantities since organic farms tend to produce less, and this results in higher costs.|n
Additionally, organic farms are usually located farther from major cities, increasing the shipping cost.|n
Since organic farmers don’t use these, their losses are higher, which costs the farmer more and increases the cost to the consumer.|n
Additionally, without all the chemical preservatives added to conventional foods, organic foods face a shorter storage time and shelf life.|n
Organic food grows more slowly Time is money.|n
Not only are organic farms typically smaller than conventional ones, but they also, on average, take more time to produce crops because they refrain from using the chemicals and growth hormones used by conventional farmers.|n
Egg color only depends on the breed of chicken, not whether the egg is organic.|0
Smaller, organic farms typically charge more for their eggs and thus can use a breed that lays fewer eggs.|n
Organic/Natural Farming is sustainable provided some patience and efforts are taken to understand our soil, climate, plants and how the ecosystem works.|p
1) Multicropping is mandatory in organic as crops complement each other and some crops are used as bait to indicate pest attacks early.|0
This helps the farmer take preventive steps to protect the main crop/s.|p
Organic farms tend to have many life forms in birds, insects, rodents, snakes etc.|p
"The food pyramid is in full flow and most of the ""bad"" insects are the primary food."|p
3) Water usage is lesser with a lot of mulching to retain the soil moisture.|p
4) Forget organic premium; most of the produce can be sold locally at Grade A rates as traders know it is good quality.|p
5) Low yields is a complaint, but that is why I gave a clear disclaimer above.|n
6) Livestock is essential for organic farming, which serves as short term income generators as well as insurance for the farmers for urgent needs.|0
Industrialization has actually brought down organic prices considerably; the price differentials used to be even higher.|p
Organic agricultural methods are internationally regulated and legally enforced by many nations, based in large part on the standards set by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM).|0
It is currently booming in india , and states such as sikkim and kerala have planned to shift fully in organic cultivation since 2015 and 2016 respectively.|p
There are many companies which promotes organic farming “Terragreen”.|0
The company also has the distinction of being led by women entrepreneurs who firmly believe in healthy and ecologically balanced farming practices, or simply, organic farming.|p
As per my knowledge in India every State has hundreds of organic farmers.|0
"As I am citizen of Chhattisgarh then Adoption And Certification Of Organic Farming ""Chhattisgarh""is required for that."|0

Hope this answer will give you direction to start organic farming in successful way.|p
organic food producing company based in Hyderabad that believes in the concept of natural food, or simply - as nature intended.|p
We produce 100% organic food from our extensive organic farms, besides being aided by organic farming communities across India.|0
As farmers ourselves, we have a hands-on approach towards organic farming, and have been actively promoting it over the years for the sake of a safer environment and a healthier you.|p
Terra Greens Organic is the result of persistent campaigning and encouraging farmers disillusioned by conventional farming methods to switch to a more sustainable, indigenous and an eco-friendly form of farming.|p
The whole store is set up to be aesthetically pleasing, it makes you want to pro-long your shop versus do it in under 20 minutes.|p
Fresh made food that feels local and healthy, you can eat it in the market or on their patio that each store has created for people to just sit and eat.|p
Environmental awareness - this is a grocery chain that is very eco and people are looking for this.|p
All in all Whole Foods has created an environment that is a destination versus a stop on a Saturday to-do list.|p
An organic, fair trade, locally sourced, etc., hamburger chain is probably a lot worse for health and environment than a GM watermelon.|0
A giant organic factory farm in China is probably worse on all counts than a project to develop pest-resistant GM seeds.|n
Extracted Information from link: Nutrient Levels in Organic Foods Until recently, the primary value of organic foods resided in just a few factors: 1) Lack of certain undesirable constituents, mainly pesticides, herbicides, petroleum-based fertilizers and genetically-modified organisms 2) Reduction in environmental degradation by not adding toxins to air, water and soil 3) Support of healthier, pesticide-free environments for farm workers However, organic gardeners and farmers have always suspected an added value of organically grown foods - higher levels of nutrients.|p
Dr. Benbrook’s research has established that organically grown vegetables and fruits contain higher levels of nutrients than their conventional counterparts.|0
Organic foods were found to be clearly higher in antioxidants, vitamin C, nitrates and some polyphenols; and moderately higher in protein.|p
Plant-based organic foods were consistently and clearly more nutrient dense, while animal-based organic foods were not consistently superior.|p
Within these studies, 236 valid matched pairs (or types) of measurements were identified which included both conventional and organic food samples.|0
There were 135 study-crop combinations covered in the 97 studies; within these 97 studies, 94 were identified as valid, where there were good comparisons between conventional and organic food.|0
The levels of 11 nutrients were compared in the matched pairs.|0
In 145 of the 236 matched pairs (61%), the organic foods were more nutrient dense.|0
In three-fourths of the cases, polyphenols and antioxidants were greater in organic than conventional foods.|p
Nutrient levels were on average 31% or more higher in organic foods than conventional in 25% of the study samples.|0
Across all 236 matched pairs and 11 nutrients, the nutritional premium of the organic food averaged 25%.|0
There are many reasons for these differences, and some of the details are interesting from a nutritional therapy perspective (Benbrook et al., 2008).|p
Antioxidants Numerous studies have found higher levels of antioxidants in organic produce than in conventional.|0
Organic tomatoes contained 79% and 97% higher levels of quercetin and kaempferol, respectively, in a long-term study conducted at the University of California - Davis (Mitchell AE et al., 2007).|0
An Italian research team seeking to create a test to distinguish between organic and conventional oranges found that vitamin C levels were higher in organic oranges (Tarozzi et al., 2006).|0
Organic red wines contain higher levels of resveratrol, polyphenols and other antioxidants (Di Renzo et al., 2007).|0
Benbrook’s team found that, in general, organically grown produce contains 30% higher levels of antioxidants than conventional produce.|0
In other words, plants need stress from pests, do not need agricultural fertilizers heavy in nitrogen and do need to grow at their own life cycle’s pace to produce the healthiest, more antioxidant-rich fruits and leaves (Benbrook et al., 2008).|0
"no.... but it also depends on what ""organic"" means."|0
Plants obtain their nutrients from the soil they grow in.|0
"Some companies are ""organic"" and that just means they do not use chemicals... some however, use more ""traditional"" farming methods which use various methods for putting nutrients back into the soil."|n
No, There are real benefits of organic food for people and the environment.|p
It is important to do your homework when choosing what to buy.|p
I do not trust the Government to regulate anything so companies and individuals need to self regulate so that consumers have trust in what they are purchasing.|0
I like the trend towards sustainable agriculture.|p
There is no nutritional advantage to organic.|n
It is purely a marketing term.|n
And if you think that organic farming isn’t commercial, you are ignoring the fact that it is a huge industry, every bit as commercial as any other.|n
100% I don’t want to let on that organic food is bad or any worse than conventionally farmed food.|p
It’s basically no better or worse, so when I say “100% overrated”, I mean that all of the purported advantages amount to nothing (and in most cases, are actually just plain myths).|n
Now there is arguably some extent to which the myths about organic food were technically true when the movement first began about 45+ years ago, but they haven’t been for a very long time.|n
That said, I would stop just short of saying that organic food is actually a fraudulent enterprise.|n
The only reason I would stop just short of that is that I don’t believe that it is necessarily the intent of those in the industry to deliberately deceive the populace… however, it doesn’t make the emperor any less naked.|n
Though there are groups like Greenpeace who do deliberately and brazenly lie to people about organic vs conventional and especially GMOs in the interest of advancing their agenda, but Greenpeace isn’t really an industry player.|n
To distill it down to a single point - and yes, I know this will inevitably lead to an oversimplification, but that’s what will happen when you try to distill anything down to a single statement - Organic food is not a movement based on food value; it’s a movement based on revulsion of science of technology.|n
The simple reason why it works is because the marketing message of organic food evokes fanciful imagery of the “olden days” against the fearsome images of poorly understood concepts of modern technology and the hatred of big megacorporate interests.|n
It’s a marketing message that plays to people's atavistic fears of that which they do not fully understand.|n
People think of technological advances in agriculture like GMOs and they picture mad scientists The latter of which is a bit hilarious since the organic food market isn’t dominated by your neighborhood farmers… it’s dominated by the likes of Wal-Mart, Costco, Kraft, Kellog’s, etc.|n
First of all, let’s begin with the belief that organic food is better for you - that’s simply untrue.|n
Actual studies show there is no advantage whatsoever when all else is equal.|n
The variables that affect nutrient quality have more to do with conditions like soil management, disease, weather, etc… and that’s the case regardless of farming process.|n
An organic tomato grown in Florida is going to have poorer nutrient quality to a conventional tomato grown in California - that’s just down to soil.|n
Moreover, the techniques that farmers use to manage soil quality and account for weather and so on are the same for organic vs. conventional farming techniques.|n
They’re actually the same techniques farmers have been using pretty much since the dawn of civilization - modern technology has merely improved the efficiency and scale at which they can do it.|n
Let’s also remember that the farming industry isn’t one in which quality drives the economy; Quantity, on the other hand, does.|n
More specifically, the money a farmer makes isn’t a function of nutrients or flavor.|n
It’s a function of the total weight of yield.|n
While an organic farmer can make a little more per kilo of yield, the total weight for a given amount of input labor and operating costs is less as well, so farmers don’t actually make good money on organic.|n
As far as taste/flavor goes, studies show that organic vs. conventional is basically a tie.|n
Moreover, there are also studies that strongly indicate that the perceived flavor advantage of organic food is entirely down to expectations.|n
In blind tests, things come out basically even (again, assuming all else equal), but if people are told that one is organic and one is conventional, the one they were told is organic tends to win, even if the subjects of the study were actually misled.|n
Also, many people believe that organic food means no pesticides or herbicides.|n
That’s actually a myth.|n
What they’re not permitted to use is synthetic pesticides and herbicides.|0
Natural ones are actually allowed (and there are several of these), and they are used in large quantities.|n
As it so happens, this is actually less “green”, because naturally sourced pesticides and herbicides tend to carry all sorts of impurities, and offer lower efficacy, which actually means that organic farmers have to use more of it to get their yields up to manageable levels… Synthetic pesticides and herbicides are more effective, can be used in smaller quantities, and are higher purity, which actually makes them many times safer and cause less contaminated runoff.|n
In fact, all outbreaks of food-borne illness from vegetables sold in the U.S. in the last 30 years have been connected exclusively to organic vegetables.|n
The only legitimate illness prevention that organic offers (and more specifically, it’s only there in the sense that it is an explicit requirement of organic meats) is that livestock feed cannot contain any animal byproducts, which thereby reduces the risk of Mad Cow disease… there’s really nothing else you can explicitly tie to organic food.|p
Really, the only reason why people don’t realize this (or believe it if the facts are laid bare) is because of their atavistic response to the idea of synthetic chemicals and the idea that that makes them inherently harmful and that anything natural is inherently good.|0
Similarly, the notion of no antibiotics or hormones in organic is also a myth.|n
What it actually is that that there are no antibiotics or hormones used specifically for purposes other than to treat diseases and/or disorders.|n
And also, any notion that these things are necessarily harmful betrays an inordinate ignorance about biochemistry, but that’s exactly why people fear it so much in the first place.|n
There’s not even the slightest shade of evidence that these things actually affect humans in any way.|n
Also, a meat that is certified organic does not mean that all of the feed stock is organically grown; it’s around 80%, and exceptions can be made if there are known nutrient deficiencies in the feed stock.|n
There are some people who believe that buying organic helps small or local farmers, and that too is a myth.|n
As mentioned before, organic is now a huge industry, and it bears all the same “evil corporate” characteristics one would associate with conventional “factory” farming.|n
You can support local growers by paying more at farmers markets, but one should take notice of the fact that this is actually a less environmentally sound approach.|n
Economies of scale actually make industrialized farming more eco-friendly overall.|n
While organic growers ostensibly make more per unit weight than conventional farmers, the fact that they are cut off from a host of technological advances means that it is not even a theoretical possiblity for them to obtain equivalent yields on the same resource input.|n
It turns out in practice that for all farm owners who own both conventional and organic plots, they make less money per acre on organic (again, assuming apples to apples, of course).|n
There is some degree of correlation between organic and lower incidence of cruel treatment of livestock.|p
it is debatable how much of this is related to the political image maintenance of organic food, and how much is because it is merely possible since organic is still a smaller subset of the overall food market.|0
That said, in spite of the propaganda campaigns, it should be also known that the horrifying images we have all seen are actually not as large an issue as demagogues would have you believe.|n
Buying organic or pushing for cruelty-free practices in all kinds of farming?|n
To a certain extent, I am torn on this one since all dollars are infinitely more powerful than all votes, but to be able to pull it off requires a certain degree to which people at large need to be informed… which I am fairly sure is never going to be possible.|n
From life, we can find that organic food is becoming more and more popular.|p
And the profits amon this area are self-evident.|p
But at the same time, the safety of food industry has long been an issue of consumer concern all over the world.|p
Undeniably, it is one of the most risky industries . |0
"The organic food market is all about making more money, not being healthy or ""natural""."|n
Foods that are labelled as organic pay a premium to be certified as such and they also charge a lot more.|n
Most of the time there is no added value to buying organic other than a nice happy feeling and a lighter wallet for you to carry around.|n
Whole Foods successfully competes mainly by having a wider selection of foods that are perceived to be healthy.|0
Here are some examples of things you can buy at Whole Foods that are hard to find elsewhere: 100% grass-fed organic beef organic almonds, pecans and any type of organic nut you want a wider selection of organic fruits and vegetables than competing markets many hard-to-find brands of organic cereals many brands organic fruit juices you will not find anywhere else for any type of grocery Whole Foods will have some unique options Whole Foods has a large prepared foods section that enables shoppers to buy food that has already been cooked.|p
Their prepared foods section is typically much larger than that of competitors It typically has more choices of prepared foods Its options are typically healthier Whole Foods also carries vitamins and personal care products that some believe are healthier for you.|p
Whole Foods is squarely focused on its target market: people who care about health and believe certain types of harder-to-find foods are better for health people who want prepared foods people who want vitamins and personal care products they perceive as healthier people who are willing to pay more for the convenience of finding all of the above in one place|p
I actually think of 'natural foods' as being organic, minimally processed and without additives.|p
Since Whole Foods carries much in the may of non-organic, highly processed and foods with added sweeteners, I do not consider it a 'natural food' store.|n
That said, I love Whole Foods and their effort to carry, provide and guide the market toward more healthful and natural choices.|p
I have a whole foods that is the closest grocery to me Sometimes they have meat cuts or seafood that I typically do not see at publix or Kroger.|p
They also have a good beer and cheese selection and interesting International foods too.|p
Whole foods is a little too expensive to be a regular stop for my budget.|n
I also do not buy the organic marketing/anti GMO stance they take, but I will tolerate it if I am in there on occasion.|n
Thus, unless I need something specific, I do general grocery shopping elsewhere.|n
However, there is one thing I love at whole foods, and that is the hot bar.|p
Whole foods's hot bar has items I like, and enough variety that I can change up from the usual greasy fried junk (some shift mates frequently eat chick fil a or zaxbys 3 times a week).|p
Yeah, it is pricy, but I like the change, and it can help me maintain healthy eating habits in an environment not so conducive to good eating.|p
Yeah, it is pricy, but I like the change, and it can help me maintain healthy eating habits in an environment not so conducive to good eating.|n
Those are the main reasons I occasionally go to whole foods.|p
"If you eat/buy organic to avoid industrial chemical and pesticide residues, then buying the foods that are on the current (2015) ""Clean 15"" list of commercially grown foods is an affordable option if you do not want to pay for organic."|n
"The fruits and vegetables on the list have low to undetectable levels of heavy metals, industrial chemicals, radiation, and pesticide residues, even though they are not grown or certified ""organic""."|p
it is important to note that even in organic farming, non-synthetic pesticides are used when necessary.|n
It is wise to double check the current Clean 15 list at regular intervals, as the foods on the list are subject to change with growing methods and seasonal production.|0
Clean 15 OnionsAvocadoSweet Corn *(watch for GMO)PineappleMangoSweet Peas (frozen)EggplantCauliflowerAsparagusKiwiCabbagePapayas *(watch for GMO)GrapefruitSweet PotatoesCantaloupe * A small amount of sweet corn, papaya and summer squash sold in the United States is produced from GE seed stock.|0
Buy organic varieties of these crops if you want to avoid GE produce.|p
that is not ethical: scaring people for no reason, and at a cost of billions to enforce the label law, helps no one except the organic farmers and corporations like Whole Foods.|0
it is great if GMO-free products want to voluntarily label themselves as GMO-free or organic.|0
I exclusively eat organic when ever possible.|0
A typical organic crop is 2% or more GMO DNA.|0
(Organic does not mean that less harm is caused to the environment.|n
Genetically modified produce cannot be labeled organic, hybrids or crosses that do not involved laboratory manipulations of the genes are not commonly considered Genetically Modified, they are usually referred to as hybrids or by their varietal name.|0
Eating organically does not have to impact your wallet, as long as you know how to engage in some smart shopping techniques.|p
Try some of the following: 1) When it comes to organic produce, buy in season or buy frozen.|0
Not only will your produce be cheaper, it will also be more delicious.|p
Learn to stock your freezer when the prices are low for the later months.|0
You can also look into preserving and even pickling produce when it is cheap to get the most bang for your buck.|p
This may come as a surprise, but there are lots of suppliers who will sell you both fresh and frozen organic produce and meats and ship it directly to your door.|p
Doing this can cut out the middleman and save you a bunch.|0
Do a quick trawl on the internet for your favorites.|0
3) Make friends with your local farmer's market.|0
Take a look around and see if you have a nearby farmer's market.|0
I have had incredible luck getting the produce and meats I want by cuddling up to the farmers, and they are usually happy to negotiate if I am purchasing a lot.|p
Additionally, you can ask them about other items you are looking for.|0
This can be tough if you are living in a small apartment, but it is worth clearing the extra room to purchase in bulk when you can.|0
Organic grains, beans and pastas all make quick and healthy meals.|p
Have a few organic canned items around too.|p
The bigger cans and jars will usually work out cheaper than the smaller ones, and you can freeze or store what you do not use right away.|p
Keeping an eye on sales at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and other supermarkets that specialize in healthy organic stuff is a key element to getting the best for your buck.|p
Suggest finding a local grower/farmer who will sell you their organic fruit and vegetables - and hopefully their grass-fed, free-range meat and poultry too.|0
Your local grower is likely to have less mark up on their organic goods than the big stores and they will probably provide delivery as well, which is saving you even more money.|p
Your local grower is likely to have less mark up on their organic goods than the big stores and they will probably provide delivery as well, which is saving you even more money.|0
You want to maximise the life of your organic stash.|0
All food is organic.|0
I think you might be confusing a farm method and organic certification.|0
Health wise eating healthier and increasing your intake of fresh fruits and veggies will provide far more health benefits.|p
Anything you can taste is a chemical and even organic certified contains chemicals and even pesticides as 1 plants produce their own pesticide properties and 2 organic uses pesticides just like all agriculture!|n
My dad grew up on a farm in China, and as my sister and I grew up, it seemed only natural that we should take advantage of his expertise, and grow our own organic food (rather than source it from overpriced groceries).|0
Yes, I care very much about what I buy and believe in using my power as a consumer to support local agriculture, reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use, and not support cruel factory farming practices.|p
I get fresh produce from a CSA (community supported agriculture) membership and then choose carefully when shopping in a supermarket (in order of priority: local, in season, organically grown, price).|p
I have the time (no kids) and the financial resources to be able to do this, so I like to think of it as doing my part to help bring down the prices of fresh and organically grown food for everyone.|p
I have the time (no kids) and the financial resources to be able to do this, so I like to think of it as doing my part to help bring down the prices of fresh and organically grown food for everyone.|n
Maybe that is a foolish rationalization of sometimes paying more, but I hate the idea of chemicals that cannot be safely applied without a full protective suit and respirator on anyone's food!|p
Ironically, that’s even truer with industrial organics, which have optimized to produce the same look and taste.|0
Something grown locally, with fewer pesticides and pre-industrial fertilizers, are likely to be smaller and uglier.|0
But they may taste better, and will have more variety.|p
Sikkim is now a 100% organic state, with no chemical pesticides or fertilizers and no GMOs.|p
This matters because it shows that organic food in an entire region is possible.|p
Now, other people in India and throughout the world are learning from Sikkim’s success, and beginning to ask, “Could organic food succeed in other areas, too?” How Sikkim became a fully organic place In 2003, due to chemically intensive, conventional farming methods, the Himalayan state’s food production faced serious environmental and health problems.|p
As a solution, the Chief Minister of Sikkim, Pawan Chamling, announced his vision for Sikkim to be India’s first organic state.|p
Twelve years later, by the end of 2015, all Sikkim’s farms were certified organic by an independent certifying body.|0
On January 18, 2016, at Sikkim’s Organic Festival, the Prime Minister of India declared the state fully organic.|p
The Sikkim Organic Mission Project, the state’s organic policy, spread awareness about why, what, and how the mission would be accomplished.|0
Organic farming was added as a subject in school.|0
Farmers attended required training on organic farming led by organic experts and scientists.|0
And they began using natural alternatives, such as compost and manure made from dung, decayed leaves, and dry grasses.|p
Various indigenous technologies were used, like pheromone traps to control fruit flies, biopesticides, and biofertilizers.|p
The Sikkim government helped make organic seeds and manures more available, helped farmers market their produce, and even sent some farmers outside the state for advanced training.|0
Why organic food is important Organic agriculture is important for our health and the future of our world for many reasons.|p
It carries far fewer toxic pesticide residues, and is grown using no GMOs.|p
Organic farming is also better suited to climate change, protects biodiversity, enhances soil fertility, and, to top it off, organic foods are more nutritious and taste better.|p
But without pesticides and other tools known for producing high-yield agriculture, would organic food really be able to produce enough food to feed people?|n
Many studies from around the world show that organic farms can produce about as much if not more food than conventional farms.|p
And in places where most of the world’s hungry live, yield gaps for organic food disappear.|p
But could the best way to preserve our water supplies, be with organic farming?|0
Organic soil is better able to hold onto water because it uses organic material.|p
Therefore, plants have more access to water, and they produce more food.|p
A way to make organic food cheap Organic food sometimes costs more.|n
But experts say the way to make organic food cheap is to get everybody on board.|0
One entrepreneur in India who has experience in agriculture put it like this: “What happens ordinarily in organic is that a retailer deals with small quantities from a wide range of farmers.|0
This adds to the cost of produce.|n
When a state is 100% organic, then the costs that go into segregating, packaging, labeling, and differential pricing, are saved.|0
When everything is organic, the price automatically falls.” How Sikkim is benefitting from becoming an organic state Sikkim’s transition to an organic state is good for public health and the environment in the area.|p
It’s also good for the economy.|p
Tourism to the area is also increasing and bringing in more money.|p
Guests can stay in organic villages, where they are able to enjoy the abundant natural beauty and eat fresh, organic meals.|p
Sikkim organic retail stores offering pulses, rice, mandarin oranges, ginger, cardamom, and turmeric have been set up by the government in New Delhi.|p
More stores are planned for other major cities.|p
Due to the surge in demand for Sikkim’s organic produce, farmers are now earning 20%more.|p
Contrary to popular belief, “organic” can actually be worse on the environment, and also be more “dangerous” to consume (depending on your definition of “dangerous”, of course.|n
Organic farming does not achieve the same yields as more modern farming techniques, so more land is used to grow the same amount of food.|n
Couple that with the odd definitions of organic in many countries and it often means that harsher, less targeted poisons (like Rotenone) are used for pest control, because they are more “natural”.|n
In fact some of the most toxic substances known to man are found in nature.|0
Because these pesticides are less targeted, they have a tendency to cause a much greater environmental effect, like killing of beneficial predator species, often resulting in a *higher* usage of pesticides than in a non organic farm.|n
You can of course find local organic farms that use no pesticides whatsoever, just don’t expect to find their produce on the shelf at Safeway, because the food will not be all that attractive to your average consumer.|0
Now there are of course some very good benefits to organic food as well.|p
Organic foods usually have a wider variety of cultivars, resulting in more variety of taste and texture for a given food type.|p
But these benefits are not really heath based, they are more quality based.|p
Over all my personal feelings are the cost is not worth it, but your opinion may vary.|n
Just don’t tell me they are healthier/more environmentally friendly, when they clearly are not.|n
I am not sure what you mean by 'organic medicine,' but I guess you want headaches to go away and these things have worked for me.|n
Perhaps food is the best organic medicine.|0
Because organic food has lesser produtivity compared the common foods.|n
While you get 100 units production of organic tomatoes, you get 1000 units of tomatoes with pesticide planting, which protect the plant against plagues.|0
And, the durability and sensivity of organic foods makes it harder to transport and conservate.|0
The shelf life is shorter, meaning the product has a quicker expiration date.|n
Since it has a quicker expiration date, the item: A.|n
cannot be made in bulk, so costs go up.|0
Is made in bulk, yet majority of the product expires, so expired products are migrated into the cost of organic inventory, raising the prices.|0
In other words, you are paying for the risk the business owner goes through the provide an organic product.|0
It is true that the Authenticity of organic products - whether it is organic or not - is difficult to trust, but more than that, I believe it is more important for us to understand the meaning of 'organic' rather than it just being defined by some 'regulatory' board.|0
There is also a lot of assumption on how we actually come to the conclusion that the seller or the farmer might have bribed the so called 'regulatory board' for organic certification.|0
Legally, there is nothing as organic which exists - at least, in India.|0
has a few clauses which can be used to question the seller in case and sue in case you find out the product they are selling is not what they claim it to be - however, there is no clear definition of the word organic.|0
However, despite the absence of regulations - the picture is not as grim - thanks to the organic movement.|0
There are norms(international and national)- like NPOP, BioSuisse, USDA, - which have set the standards for someone who wants to go organic (From conventional) - and there are agencies (mostly private) which conform to these guidelines and certify producers based on a fee.|0
Also, for a country like India, where there are many farmers who have very small land holdings and not good access to information and funds - it might never be possible for many farmers to get the certification despite having organic practices in their farming (I personally know 4 such farmers who practice organic just because they believe in it and they do not find it important for someone else to 'certify' their produce)... For this too, there is a low cost certification method which exists - called PGS (Participatory guarantee scheme) . |0
Though PGS is not recognized by the certifying agencies - some of the best organic farmer groups I know in India are PGS certified.|0
To answer how organic food can be made cheap?|0
I know some families in my town have tied up with farmers close to us and they have made an agreement with them to buy from them - and they also participate in planning their sowing... consult them on organic practices..|0
This way - not only you get to know how your food is being produced - you get cheaper food, and farmers get better prices too, In Kolkata and Jamshedpur, there are 'haats/ market' organized once in a week or so .. where a group of farmers bring their produce and sell it directly to customers - the transportation and rent for the place is managed by the cooperative's funds (ngo shyamoli) . |p
Both these groups are consulted on their organic practices by the group of consumers/ local volunteers.|p
In a normal 'big city' situation too, there are ways through which you can be more assured of someone's claim to be organic or not.|0
Ask the seller for the source (which farmer, which village) - if there is a certification - which agency has certified (some of the most trusted names are IMO, EcoCert, CU, Vaidik, Lacone.. and many others too 2.|0
Organic brands - if they want to build trust - should either show certification or should be completely transparent - to the extent of percentage of price going to the farmers - visits to the farmer group|0
I also think there are good answers here: What are the biggest misconceptions about organic food?|0
And finally, I will build off what Bruce Ames has to say about all the worries about chemicals (and organic food).|0
we are eating natural pesticides, which are natural chemicals that plants use to try to kill off insects that try to eat them.|0
And we eat roughly 1,500 milligrams of them per day.|0
We eat 0.09 milligrams of synthetic pesticide residues.|0
So we are talking about incredibly tiny amounts of synthetic pesticides, and yet the same percentage of natural chemicals come out positive.|0
"He also mentions organic foods, calling it ""nonsense"" from a consumer health standpoint, though he does allude that for agricultural workers, it can be important."|0
My point in all this is that if organic has any benefits, it is insignificant.|n
If you are shopping in the Western world, you can be confident your food is pretty safe, no matter what you eat.|0
"The differences are insignificant considering the wide array of agricultural practices you might define as ""organic"" or ""conventional,"" and it is insignificant considering the many other unhealthy things we all do and eat."|n
There are damaging ways to farm, and there are safe and sustainable ways.|p
Labels have very little to do with it.|n
Until the 20th century, all farming was organic, and the record of famine, erosion, plant disease, and permanently degraded soils is irrefutable.|p
Modern organic farmers in rich countries farm in a very responsible manner.|p
It’s another story in poor countries.|n
Of course, in poor countries, the environmental record of using modern techniques is pretty lousy too.|n
But the high priests of the organic movement somehow think seed varieties male a difference too, even though almost none of the crop seeds in use today would have occurred naturally.|n
It is certainty true that farming without pesticides and herbicides will not present the risk of those chemicals getting into people, soils, air, or water.|p
However, because of reduced yields, the same amount of land, water, fuel, and labor is used to produce less food.|n
I think this is wasteful.|n
All vegetables are really organic in the strict chemical definition of that term, but if you mean have been grown with our using synthetic pesticides or fertiliser, then it depends where you live.|0
Certainly in the UK and Germany and probably in the EU generally, there are very strict rules and you can not legally market your product as organic if you have not adhered to them.|0
I do not believe that the term organic has a strict legal definition and as such it would probably depend on which state you were in.|0
The term Organic is protected by the USDA at the federal level in much the same fashion as in the EU.|0
Individual states sometimes have additional standards or requirements, but in general follow the lead of the federal government.|0
The standards in the US are part of the National Organic Program (NOP) and are strictly regulated.|0
"As an organic farmer, I cannot use the ""O"" word to describe my produce or practices unless I acquire organic certification."|0
"""Organic"" is only part of the picture - you have to be aware of country of origin and practices in that country."|0
For instance, I would mostly prefer to buy conventional food from the US or Australia/New Zealand to buying organic food from China.|p
And it doesn’t consider newfangled methods like vertical farming.|n
So I guess the answer is to use organic methods on GM crops.|p
In case the question changes, the one I answered was: “Is there a significant difference in the environmental impacts of organic vs GMO agricultural practices?”|0
In general organic is worse for the environment and GMO better.|n
Organic methods are typically low yield, which means they have a bigger resource impact, including the amount of land required.|n
In the U.S., at least, they also use pesticides which are more toxic than those used in conventional farming, and in higher quantities.|n
Studies show there is no significant different in the nutritional value of organic food compared to non-organic.|0
Personally I prefer organic, though I am not on a fully organic diet.|p
For the 3rd reason is probably why Debbie thinks organic celery tastes better.|p
Its more flavorful because it is not as saturated with water.|p
Same goes for watermelon, organic water melon tastes better and has a firmer texture.|p
Further more, I prefer local food.|p
Organic is a scam 80% of the time.|n
"Archer Farms ""organic"" food is a joke."|n
Look on the packaging and you will notice food additives, where as these are synthetic compounds.|n
"Organic certifications are not strict enough, and if you have something like canned green beans that are ""organic"" they may still have non-organic ingredients or additives, however the green beans themselves are organic."|n
I buy local because nutrition in food degrades over time, and I want to buy from a farmer that cares.|p
Just like a burger from a nice litter burger joint tastes better than from burger king.|p
Not only does the produce not travel as far, but the people who make your food actually care about your food and enjoy doing what they do.|p
Probably the biggest key to having more nutritious food is growing it yourself or buying local, nutrition degrades with time, and nutrition is at its peak when the plant is ripe.|p
Almost all vegetables and fruits in the super market are artificially ripened, even if its labeled organic.|n
Just buy local, talk to the farmer, see where your food is coming from.|p
"But do not trust everything with ""Organic"" labelled on it !"|n
Many organic dairy products available in the market are either UHT or treated some how to ensure longer shelf life.|0
So go for only FRESH Organic milk.|p
The genuine certified Organic Milk from recognized farms is produced without the use of pesticides, growth hormones, genetically modified organisms.|p
FRESH Organic milk has more fat-soluble nutrients - omega-3 fatty acid, Vitamin E and beta-carotene - than non-organic and long lasting organic milk.|p
Obviously FRESH Organic milk tastes better; milk as it used to taste, with a clear, pure and fresh flavor.|p
Here's a great example for a genuine certified organic FRESH milk from UK'Darlington Farms' by Acorn Dairy.|0
It is certified Organic by the UK Soil Association, Red Tractor certified - UK’s recognised farm and quality food assurance scheme.|0
This question probably makes the assumption that organic food has quality or health benefits.|0
The answer is clearly a no.|n
I lay them out in my post here: Organic vs conventional food Quality-wise, people may argue they can taste the difference.|0
This, however, is a poor way to truly determine nutrition or truly, even taste perception, as being told the food is organic makes people rate it higher . |n
Firstly, it is important to note that organic farmers also use pesticides, and conventional farmers also minimise pesticide use through Integrated Pest Management ( IPM , natural predator insects, crop rotation, cover crops, etc).|n
In this regard organic pesticides are no more benign than conventional , you can see comparisons with conventional and organic pesticides and other everyday chemicals in a table in this post: The dose makes the poison.|0
It turns out, when they looked at natural vs synthetic chemicals in general, researchers have come to the conclusion that natural or not does not make a big difference.|0
A comment on that study: Until recently, nobody bothered to look at natural chemicals (such as organic pesticides), because it was assumed that they posed little risk.|n
But when the studies were done, the results were somewhat shocking: you find that about half of the natural chemicals studied are carcinogenic as well.|n
We assumed that “natural” chemicals were automatically better and safer than synthetic materials, and we were wrong.|n
More on organic vs synthetic pesticides: Some organic approved pesticides are very benign (low hazard) materials, but so are a great many of the synthetic pesticides used by conventional farmers.|p
Some organic-approved pesticides are slightly to moderately toxic.|n
There are many pesticides that are used by both conventional and organic growers.|0
Some of the pesticides commonly used on organic crops are applied at rather high rates (pounds per treated acre).|n
Some are approved for use until almost immediately before harvest.|0
In any case, organic-approved pesticides definitely leave residues on treated crops by the time they reach the consumer.|n
- Why You Can Feel Guilt-free Buying Non-Organic Produce Unfortunately, we are in the dark about organic pesticide residues.|n
Unfortunately, I learned that this new testing program is only there to encourage compliance with the organic rules, not to document anything about relative residue levels.|0
There will be no testing for organically approved pesticides.|n
"From: <URL>"" There has not been, and still is not any testing of the organic pesticide residue."|n
Likely the risks from either kinds of residue is very small for the consumer, however, and there is no reason for worry.|p
The cost of buying organic is felt by your wallet and the environment, as organic farming at present unfortunately exerts a greater toll on our natural resources than conventional farming - it demands more land, and produces more nitrogen run-off for instance.|n
Meanwhile, what would be best for the environment were to only choose to buy organic for those crops where yield is not much lower (lower yields equal more wasted resources), or even higher than conventional.|n
Meanwhile, what would be best for the environment were to only choose to buy organic for those crops where yield is not much lower (lower yields equal more wasted resources), or even higher than conventional.|0
This recent overview of US data by Steve Savage in Forbes: The Lower Productivity Of Organic Farming: A New Analysis And Its Big Implications has some good tables for more information about that.|n
It seems to suggest that in the US organic artichokes, peas, sweet corn, sweet potatoes and snap beans may carry a smaller environmental burden than most other organic vegetables.|p
The other show 10 - 71 % lower yields than conventionally grown varieties, which means that more labour, resources and land is needed for organic farming to get the same result as for conventional.|n
Organic farming is a term which has become popular very recently, however there is nothing new in the buzz word.|p
So my answer to your question is Yes you can implement organic farming in your place.|p
In case you are looking for ways in which you can get healthy vegetables for yourself and your family, then all you need to do is start organic vegetable gardening in your premises.|0
Organic vegetable gardening is easy to do, cost-effective and provides you with vegetables which are oozing with nutrients.|0
Also research shows that organic vegetables helps in keeping many lifestyle related and chronic diseases at bay.|p
There are studies which show that organic food is the best defense against your kids premature puberty.|p
And most of all, organic gardening is eco-friendly.|p
There is zero health or nutritional benefit to be gained by spending twice what you need to on organic.|0
There is zero health or nutritional benefit to be gained by spending twice what you need to on organic.|n
You can feed bugs, or feed people.|n
However, there are several healthy, sensible food practices that will allow you to further reduce your exposure to any pesticide residues that may remain on your food.|p
Therefore, saying fruits are coated in pesticides would be a gross overstatement.|0
Source: Food Safety - National Pesticide Information Center Some of the sensible practices they mention include: Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables to minimize the potential of increased exposure to a single pesticide.|0
Thoroughly wash all produce, even that which is labeled organic and that which you plan to peel.|n
Scrub firm fruits and vegetables, like melons and root vegetables.|0
The sweeping public opinion that organic food is healthier than conventional food is quite strong, and is the main reason for increase in its demand over the past 5-6 years.|p
This article will explain what organic food is, how it is beneficial and what are the standards for the same.|p
This is to substantiate the public opinion that we have on organic food being good for the health.|p
First of all, there is a small amount of scientific evidence to show that organic food is better in quality than conventional food.|n
Scientific research conducted thus far on various organic food items has not been able to give strong evidence about the superiority of organic food over non-organic food.|n
However, there are some scientific studies that have proved organic milk and organic tomatoes to be better than the non-organic varieties.|p
Studies are also ongoing about a variety of other types of organic food that may have additional health benefits compared to the non-organic varieties.|p
According to the researchers at the Danish Institute of Agricultural Research at the University of Aberdeen and the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research, organic milk is healthier than non-organic milk, since organic cows are pasture grazed which results in the better quality of milk.|p
Organic Tomatoes According to a 10-year study conducted by the University of California, Davis, organic tomatoes are produced in an environment that has a lower nutrient supply since nitrogen-rich chemical fertilizers are not added.|0
This leads to an excessive formation of antioxidants, such as quercetin (79% higher) and kaempferol (97% higher) in organic tomatoes.|p
As we all know, antioxidants are good for health and help in reducing heart disease and the chances of developing cancer.|p
These studies have increased the hopes of numerous people who strongly believe that mankind should stop using chemical fertilizers and pesticides and shift to more sustainable organic farming practices.|p
There are many studies that prove that there is some pesticide and fertilizer contamination in non-organic food, and there are others which claim that organic food is not healthy because they contain harmful bacteria and viruses because of not using strong chemicals to protect against these toxic substances.|n
Health Benefits Of Organic Food In general, organic food consumers, manufacturers, and farmers strongly believe that organic food has the following benefits compared to conventional food.|0
Antioxidant Capacity A number of studies have been completed regarding the effects of antioxidants derived from organic foods on your overall health, and the predominant results have shown that antioxidants tend to have more of an impact when they come from organic foods.|p
This may be due to the fact that foreign chemicals are not negatively interacting with the different vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds that are so essential for the positive impact of fruits and vegetables in the prevention of things like cancer, heart disease, premature aging, vision problems, and cognitive malfunction.|p
Recent research suggests that choosing organic food can lead to increased intake of nutritionally desirable antioxidants and reduced exposure to toxic heavy metals.|p
Pesticide Reduction One of the major complaints that organic food consumers cite when choosing organic over non-organic is the presence of pesticides.|p
In order to keep crops from being attacked by the natural world, including bugs, pesticides are required.|0
To be fair, many people do choose to go organic to make sure that their children grow up healthy and unaffected by the toxins of the world during their developmental years.|p

Natural fertilizers, like manure, work perfectly fine, and organic farmers are happy to use this smellier, yet safer, form of fertilizer.|p
Better Taste Some people strongly believe that organic food tastes better than conventional food.|p
Furthermore, organic food is often sold locally, resulting in availability of fresh produce in the market, which usually does taste better than produce that has been frozen, shipped, and transported across long distances.|p
Environmental Safety As harmful chemicals are not used in organic farming, there is minimal soil, air and water pollution; thus ensuring a safer and healthier world for future generations to live in.|p
Animal Welfare Animal welfare is an important aspect of producing organic milk, organic meat, organic poultry, and organic fish.|p
People feel happy that the animals are not confined to a miserable caged life when they eat organic animal products.|p
The below frequently asked questions will help you understand organic food and its benefits in a better way What is Organic Food?|p
On an overall basis, organic food is food prepared and processed without using any chemicals.|0
That is, organic food production does not involve the use of chemical fertilizers, chemical pesticides, or chemical preservatives.|0
Normally people believe that organic food is better for your health than conventional food.|p
Scientific research has also not been able to conclusively prove that organic food is healthier than conventional food because there has been counter research too to prove conventional food is better than organic one.|n
The exceptions are organic milk and organic tomatoes.|p
Recent studies on organic milk and organic tomatoes have shown that these food products are healthier than non-organic milk and non-organic tomatoes, respectively.|p
Organic food can be identified with the help of an organic logo on the packet.|0
It is illegal to sell non-organic food with an organic label.|0
Yes, organic food normally costs 20% to 100% more than conventional food.|n
Many parents believe that organic food is safer for their children, since it does not contain any chemical pesticides and fertilizers.|p
So far, scientific research has proven this only for organic milk and organic tomatoes.|p
Organic milk has more omega-3, CLA, vitamins, and antioxidants than non-organic milk.|p
Similarly, organic tomatoes have more antioxidants than non-organic tomatoes.|p
While the regulations vary from country to country, in the U.S., organic crops must be grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, bioengineered genes (GMOs), petroleum-based fertilizers, and sewage sludge-based fertilizers.|0
Organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must have access to the outdoors and be given organic feed.|p
Actually i see there’s a lot of hype created for organic vegetables , fruits and food stuff.|n
organic vegetables and fruits are beleived to be grown without the use of pesticides and fertilizers but i doubt how much is that possible?|n
And i have also observed the taste difference between organic and the conventional products.|p
They say organic produce is good for the body in the long run.|p
But i personally prefer the conventional vegetables and fruits washed well and consumed.|n
Finally Its one’s choice what they prefer to consume.|0
In my 25 years as an organic farmer I have never used a pesticide of any sort.|p
I thought I did not like them much until I began eating organic for certain foods.|p
Organic from several different providers have lacked the bitterness as well as the 'chemical' taste and are sweeter like a low sugar melon to my palate.|p
For most fruits and veg, my experience is that the strain of the plant has more influence than farming method on quality of taste-a mass market strain of something might be chosen more for shelf life or appearance than flavor but the organic strains seem to be more often chosen for flavor due to the marketing approach being different.|n
I agree with the answers that have already been given, but with one caveat.|0
Organic food can taste bland as it is not enhanced by artificial additives.|n
You can still get fresh food, organic or not, but in the 1950's it would have been more commonplace that any given diner dealt with fresher ingredients.|0
There are ranches that produce grass-fed beef but do not go through the rigorous requirements to get the organic label.|n
that is going to produce a bigger taste difference from typical supermarket beef than organic beef that is been finished (fattened) on organic corn.|0
that is going to taste much the same as regular supermarket milk.|0
And much of what you get at a farmers' market will be excellent but not organic, because compliance with the organic regime can be prohibitively expensive for a small farmer.|n
Some organic products happen to also be locally-grown, grass-fed, etc.|0
For vegetables, yeah, at least in terms of flavor.|p
(I find that the meats taste decidedly better, and I do believe the animals are treated better, albeit not nearly as well as I want them to be.)|p
There may be environmental reasons to prefer the organic, but I think they’re hard to quantify.|0
"If there is a taste difference it has nothing to do with the food being ""organic""."|0
"But some ""organic"" farms also have practices that can lead to prettier or tastier food."|0
it is not a guarantee.|0
Organic is a marketing term.|n
Organic is a marketing term with no useful definition.|n
But most techniques sold as organic are ill suited for large volumes, so I suspect that the country that becomes the world's food supplier will more likely use science based agriculture such as GMO.|n
Today's natural foods, of course, are much cleaner, but many are still sickened and occasionally killed by e.coli, listeria, and salmonella, largely on account of the manure fertilizer.|n
The number is far greater than those whose health might have been damaged by minute pesticide residues.|n
Undoubtedly, some farm *workers* have been injured or killed by pesticides, something that would be unlikely on an organic farm, because the pesticides they are allowed to use are less concentrated.|p
Organic farmers still use poisons, however.|n
If you wish to eat meat, organic pastured types (or those indicating that the animals were not given hormones) are the most recommended to avoid cause for concern in this regard.|p
No, not all food is organic, and a thoughtful and thorough answer will take longer than I have on my phone battery.|0
Organic farming requires natural solutions to these issues.|0
Preying mantises to eat destructive aphids, pulling weeds from the ground, and manure for fertilizer.|0
But, I think what you may be after is that the margins are slightly better but narrowing compared to conventional techniques.|0
There are huge commercial farms that have lobbied for and diluted the original definitions proposed for organics, and produce large quantities of produce on a maginally better margin than their conventional crops because their process is not much differentiated.|n
I have a neighbor who sells 'hand raised' organic muscovy ducks to white cloth restaurants at twice the margin he gets at the farmer's market.|0
The main issue is that organic farming produces less food per unit of land than 'conventional' agriculture - sometimes by as much as 50%, but it depends.|n
So with a still-expanding global population and a finite (and, in some areas, disappearing) amount of available arable land, large-scale organic farming is not efficient enough to meet demand.|n
it is also less consistently reliable as it eschews modern techniques for resisting age-old threats (such as blight) and newer ones (like increasingly unpredictable weather).|n
Finally, it is less 'green' with higher water usage and more CO2 released.|n
I found this Forbes article with a brief but fairly comprehensive round-up Why Organic is not 'Sustainable'|n
You are unlikely to find shops selling organic produce in UP (NOIDA is the only likely place).|0
Asking around at farms is the only other possibility, but then organic farming is yet to make inroads.|0
Apart from the organic food hopefully being produced according to a policy on which agricultural techniques are allowed in its production.|0
Which doesn’t affect nutrition, usually, but might have an impact on ecology and residues of pesticides, antibiotica etc.. That said, many ‘organic’ certificates are not very strict, politely put.|0
Not worth the paper they’re printed on, to be more blunt about it.|0
"There are grants given for organic production research and farmers who are organic in their methods can enroll in ""government programs""."|0
A farmer growing organic corn can sign up for programs that all corn growers can sign up for.|0
And, organic methods can be as good as non organic...and in certain situations will outperform non organic methods, depending on how run down the soil biome and soil structure is due to abuse.|p
"Chipotle claims using ""food with integrity"" but does not claim that all their sources are organic or non GMO."|0
it is not like there is any nutritional difference between organic, non-organic, GMO and non-GMO foods.|0
Organic fruits and vegetables have the potential to be more nutritious than conventional produce, but the reality depends on the details.|p
As Ryan Carlyle explains, the use of pesticides and fertilizers does not appear to affect nutritive value.|0
See Why Organic Food May Not Be Healthier For You for a summary.|n
It has now been shown that organic dairy and meat has a different balance of fatty acids, one that has a higher proportion of omega-3s.|p
New Study Adds To The Evidence . |0
First, ripeness affects content.|0
Fruits that ripen on the plant generally do have more vitamins and a different balance of sugars, fats, proteins, etc., than fruits that are picked when unripe and then ripened over time or with chemical stimulation.|p
So if your organic fruit comes from a local farm, it probably is slightly more nutritious and almost certainly tastes better.|p
Second, choice of variety has systematic effects on nutritional content.|0
"If your ""organic"" produce is also ""heirloom,"" you are eating more nutritious food."|0
")Overall, if you are very selective about what locally grown organic heirloom produce you buy, you could definitely get more ""bang for your bite."""|0
"But if you are more concerned about ""bang for your buck,"" a balanced diet of conventional foods is an easier way to stay healthy."|n
Shopping the perimeter of the store where you find whole foods -- produce, meats/seafood, grains, dairy -- is a good start.|p
If you want to avoid GMOs, shop for certified organic products or products that have gone through the non-GMO verified.|p
There is also no demonstrated food safety or nutritional difference between organic milk and conventional milk.|n
I think it is fair to say that cows in an organic system are treated more humanely.|p
If this matters to you, feel free to pay the price premium that organic milk provides.|0
Why is organic food produce more expensive than conventionally grown fruits, vegetables and grains?|n
I also wonder if organic food is overpriced or is all conventional supermarket foods underpriced.|0
Once opened it is no longer aseptic, so you have to refrigerate it, but it is so sterile that it will last longer than milk conventionally pasteurized.|n
Organic milk tends to be UHT pasteurized because it was shipped so far; there used to be relatively few organic dairies.|0
You can get UHT conventional milk (sometimes even on the shelves next to the dried and evaporated milk), but for the most part UHT and organic go hand in hand.|0
That makes a relatively small dent in the price of organic milk, which is already a premium.|n
But if I have $50 for groceries and tomatoes are $1.99 and the organic tomatoes are $4.99, I am probably going to go and buy the normal tomatoes.|n
Because we are not rich and I like to feed my family and not have them die.|n
If a product is labeled organic then there are rigid standards to follow.|p
In simple terms organic refers to food that is grown without chemical fertilizers and pesticides which is theoretically better for your health since the body's immune system does not have to work so hard to remove these toxins ingested with the food; and also the soil condition is enhanced with natural composting methods which makes a healthier bio-system for microorganisms, insects and all creatures living downstream or upwind.|p
When you buy organic food you are paying for food clean from undesirable toxins and also paying the farmer to be a good caretaker of the land.|p
As what has already been mentioned, cows are herbivorous, but that doesn’t guarantee that they are vegetarian or even vegan.|n
When cows are deficient in some minerals that they cannot get from their primary diet of grass and legumes, they will get by eating bones, animal flesh, soil, wood and drinking urine.|n
This condition is called “pica.” Cattle experiencing pica are deficient in minerals including phosphorus, sodium and potassium.|0
That is no fault of the farmer either if there’s plenty of bugs or bug parts found in their feed!|0
All other animal by-products like blood meal, bone meal, and fish meal are prohibited due to BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or Mad Cow Disease) concerns.|0
Generally, cows in the US are fed alfalfa, corn grain, corn silage (the whole corn chopped, packed and fermented in a concrete pit), timothy, tall fescue (endophyte-free), orchard grass, perennial/annual ryegrass, millet, sorghum-sudan, sorghum, etc.|0
Generally any feed that is high in nutrients for energy, protein, and calcium are great for feeding dairy cows.|0
By-products fed to dairy cows include soybean meal, canola meal, dried distiller’s grains (DDGs), brewer’s yeast, cull potatoes, cull edible beans and peas, bakery products/waste, soybean hulls, etc.|0
There are actually a lot of by-products out there that contain a significant amount of protein and energy to meet the nutritional needs of dairy cows without having to purchase by-products derived from animals.|0
Many dairy farms in Canada have to do that because unlike the United States, chicken and table waste are also prohibited from being fed to cattle for the same concerns with BSE.|0
There is very little difference between organic vs. conventional dairy production.|0
The only difference is use of antibiotics (when cows are sick and as ionophores in the feed) and somatic growth hormone (rBST sold as Posilac) in conventional cows, and that conventional cows can consume feeds raised with the use of pesticides and commercial fertilizers.|0
Organic cows must be on feed that was organically raised, and sick cows treated with anything that is not a conventional drug).|0
Basically the brands that are sold are those brands that purchase milk from the dairy farmers that raise the cows to give milk.|0
They have different farms they source from, and those farms are generally independent from those companies.|0
This means an organic farmer can’t plant GMO seeds, an organic cow can’t eat GMO alfalfa or corn, and an organic soup producer can’t use any GMO ingredients.|p
To meet the USDA organic regulations, farmers and processors must show they aren’t using GMOs and that they are protecting their products from contact with prohibited substances, such as GMOs, from farm to table.|p
Organic operations implement preventive practices based on site-specific risk factors, such as neighboring conventional farms or shared farm equipment or processing facilities.|0
For example, some farmers plant their seeds early or late to avoid organic and GMO crops flowering at the same time (which can cause cross-pollination).|0
Others harvest crops prior to flowering or sign cooperative agreements with neighboring farms to avoid planting GMO crops next to organic ones.|0
Farmers also designate the edges of their land as a buffer zone where the land is managed organically, but the crops aren’t sold as organic.|0
Any shared farm or processing equipment must be thoroughly cleaned to prevent unintended exposure to GMOs or prohibited substances.|0
Roughly 4-5% of US food sales are organic according to the Organic Trade Association (OTA) and old data from the USDA (at Organic Market Overview).|0
Picking from the OTA’s press release U.S. organic sales post new record of $43.3 billion in 2015 For 2015 in the US: $43.3 billion in sales “Nearly 5% of all food sold in the US was organic” “Almost 13 percent of the produce sold in this country is now organic.” “Dairy accounts for 15 percent of total organic food sales.” “produce and dairy account for more than half of total organic food sales,” “non-food products account for just 8.2% of overall organic sales” “Growth in the non-food category was led by organic fiber, followed closely by organic supplements.” Organic consumption varies by location.|p
It shows much farm activity in the northeast, west coast and upper mid-west.|p
I am unable to open your first link about pesticides used on organic crops.|0
Rotenone has been phased out in the USA, although it may still be found in other countries.|0
Country of origin is very important in choosing organic food, partly because of how strictly standards are followed, but also because of the quality of the water supply used to grow the food.|0
Organic food from China is not worth eating - their water is heavily polluted.|n
My understanding is that the pesticides that are actually commonly used in organic farming in the USA are far less toxic than many of the synthetic pesticides.|0
They break down very quickly into benign compounds.|p
There is no question that regular consumption of conventional produce leaves pesticide residues in the blood, which can be eliminated by switching to an organic diet.|p
Can you show any evidence that an organic diet results in significant pesticide residues in the human body?|0
I don’t eat organic food but I always choose free range eggs.|0
it is never been proven that organic produce is more nutrient dense, so the answer is probably no, but without question eating organic food has benefits.|p
Organic foods are not subjected to the potentially harmful pesticides or drugs that non organic foods generally are.|p
Organic foods follow a stringent protocol to be deemed organic, without a chemical in sight!|p
These chemical pesticides and drugs are of course deemed safe to inevitably end up in our diets, but many people, myself included, question this 'safety', and prefer food to be more natural and to be chemical and drug free.|p
it is personal choice, but I would say that if you were weighing up your decision on going organic, then do not base it on nutrient density alone.|0
In Germany (other European countries will be similar), the main differences are: The type of feed allowed The minimum area, the way that area is equipped and access to the outdoors per chicken required The type and amounts of pharmaceuticals allowed The facilities where the chickens are kept must be designed to allow them to engage in “natural” behaviour, like roosting, digging, taking sand baths and roaming around.|p
They need to have access to outdoor “pasture” for at least a third of the time, and be allowed an uninterrupted rest period without artificial light of eight hours per day.|p
The maximum amount of Chickens per coop is 3000 and no more than six per m² (still too many and too little space, IMHO, but better than other forms of industrial egg production).|p
The coops need to permanently admit fresh air and natural light.|p
The feed needs to be produced according to the standards for organic farming, as well, and be primarily grown locally.|p
No genetically engineered plants in it, no synthetically produced additives, no “preventative” antibiotics, steroids or what have you.|p
Specific organic farming co-ops/labelling systems usually follow stricter criteria, the above is pretty much the minimum for eggs to be labelled as organic.|p
So, to sum it up: Don’t buy any other eggs in Europe, except from a local farmer where the chickens are kept in small numbers with even more space who’s just too small to shell out for the certificate… The higher standards for the treatment of the chickens is well worth it, and the least we can do.|p
Help make keeping chickens in worse conditions unviable as a business model.|p
Broad labels that have absolutely no meaning.|n
Organic pesticides/herbicides can be just as dangerous as conventional ones… or just as harmless, or even completely identical.|n
Despite decades of testing, no evidence exists that any of these categories is healthier or less or more nutritious than the other [barring GMOs specifically made to be more nutritious like Golden Rice, but that should be obvious].|0
Despite decades of testing, no evidence exists that any of these categories is more likely to cause cancer, allergies, autism, food poisoning, death, or anything else.|0
On the contrary, we have evidence that some risks are equal.|0
"The definitions of ""organic,"" ""conventional,"" and ""GMO"" has and will continue to change over time and national borders, among other factors."|0
A chemist will say anything is organic.|0
A strict Jainist will say all agriculture is evil.|0
That each of these is equally associated with multinational companies… and with nonprofit organizations, universities, governments, and other researchers who will make no profits from any product and are just trying to save the world as best as they can.|0
Glyphosate is also sprayed on a lot of non-GMO crop plantings, either before or after the growing of the crops, so there is a lot in things like millet, for instance, and it is also present in meat and especially edible organs -- so if you are going to cook liver, for instance, you absolutely, definitely want to get an organically raised animal's organs.|p
Anyway, the best advice is to buy organically certified foods if you can, especially when it comes to anything that is soy or corn based.|p
I eat local eggs, some locally raised meat, good quality butter, olive oil, lots of fresh vegetables, and some processed foods (organic or made from organic ingredients).|p
I have decided that I will live with organic food as the lesser evil.|p
I often travel in the US and always buy organic foods there.|0
I also recently traveled to Europe and bought organic food as much as I could.|0
By avoiding it as much as possible I hope that I live a healthier life.|p
Organic food may not be the best, but it is all we have left under the USDA.|p
But there are environmental benefits to “organic”.|p
I know morons go on about how it tastes better or is “healthier”, and that none of this is backed up by the large number of studies.|n
But organic is definitely better for wildlife, that is worth paying extra for (IMO).|p
Organic produce contains fewer pesticides.|p
Organic food is often fresher.|p
Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts.|p
Organic meat and milk are richer in certain nutrients.|p
Organic food is GMO-free.|0
You can get organic food products in delhi from cowboys, Cowboys are one of the Best Organic Food Products company in Delhi, Suppliers of organics food products such as Cow Ghee, Cow Milk, Pure Honey, Organics dairy products.|p
Some studies have shown higher levels of antioxidants in organic foods and that more animals and people prefer the taste.|p
Furthermore one of the stipulations of a food being organic in the United States was that an organic food could have been genetically modified in a lab so it is in it is most natural state.|0
When it comes to meats etc you can also feel a little more at ease with your conscience because organic livestock are required to have more access to the outdoors.|p
Organic is not always better.|n
He knows the eggs that are “organic” and “cage-free” are actually coming from hens who have no hen house so half are pecked to death by boss hens (a terrible death) but the humans aren’t allowed to stop the abusive pecking deaths because they are required to make the living conditions for the hens exactly what it would be like in the wild.|n
Same thing with organic.|0
It depends, if they are Organic on principal because they want their land and their animals to be as healthy and clean as possable, and they want to spread the Organic message.|p
Then they are probably charging as close to their margins as possable.|0
There is no getting away from the fact that Organic means more time, and less productivity, all that costs money.|n
If a busness is using the word Organic cynically, without staying true to the principals of Organic farming, then they are probably making a bucketload.|0
For example almost all honey's can be labelled organic.|0
But nobody can really know what a bee is getting its necter from.|0
(There are some exceptions to this, Manuka honey from NZ for example.)|0
So I would not pay any extra for organic honey.|0
But I would pay extra for an organic chicken.|p
Organic farming may be a methodology of crop and placental mammal production that involves far more than selecting to not use pesticides, fertilizers, genetically changed organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones.|0
Organic production may be a holistic system designed to optimize the productivity and fitness of numerous communities inside the agro-ecosystem, together with soil organisms, plants, placental mammal and other people.|0
The principal goal of organic production is to develop enterprises that ar property and harmonious with the setting.|0
The general principles of organic production, from the Canadian Organic Standards (2006), embrace the following: defend the setting, minimize soil degradation and erosion, decrease pollution, optimize biological productivity and promote a sound state of health maintain semipermanent soil fertility by optimizing conditions for biological activity inside the soil maintain biological diversity inside the system recycle materials and resources to the best extent attainable inside the enterprise give attentive care that promotes the health and meets the behavioral desires of placental mammal prepare organic product, action careful process, and handling ways so as to keep up the organic integrity and important qualities of the product in the least stages of production think about renewable resources in regionally organized agricultural systems Organic farming promotes the utilization of crop rotations and canopy crops, and encourages balanced host/predator relationships.|p
Organic residues and nutrients created on the farm ar recycled back to the soil.|0
Cover crops and composted manure are accustomed maintain soil organic matter and fertility.|0
Integrated pest and weed management, and soil conservation systems are valuable tools on an organic farm.|0
Organically approved pesticides include “natural” or other pest management products included in the Permitted Substances List (PSL) of the organic standards.|0
The Permitted Substances List identifies substances permitted for use as a pesticides in organic agriculture.|0
All grains, forages and protein supplements fed to livestock must be organically grown.|0
The organic standards generally prohibit products of genetic engineering and animal cloning, synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, synthetic drugs, synthetic food processing aids and ingredients, and ionizing radiation.|0
Prohibited products and practices must not be used on certified organic farms for at least three years prior to harvest of the certified organic products.|0
Livestock must be raised organically and fed 100 per cent organic feed ingredients.|0
Organic farming presents many challenges.|0
Some crops are more challenging than others to grow organically; however, nearly every commodity can be produced organically.|0
Growth of Organic Agriculture The world market for organic food has grown for over 15 years.|n
The retail organic food market in Canada is estimated at over $1.5 billion in 2008 and $22.9 billion in the U.S.A. in 2008.|0
It is estimated that imported products make up over 70 per cent of the organic food consumed in Canada.|0
Canada also exports many organic products, particularly soybeans and grains.|0
The Canadian Organic Farmers reported 669 certified organic farms in Ontario in 2007 with over 100,000 certified organic acres of crops and pasture land.|0
This is an annual increase of approximately 10 per cent per year in recent years.|0
About 48 per cent of the organic cropland is seeded to grains, 40 per cent produces hay and pasture and about five per cent for certified organic fruits and vegetables.|0
Why Farm Organically?|0
The main reasons farmers state for wanting to farm organically are their concerns for the environment and about working with agricultural chemicals in conventional farming systems.|0
Organic farmers find their method of farming to be profitable and personally rewarding.|p
Why Buy Organic?|0
Consumers purchase organic foods for many different reasons.|0
Many want to buy food products that are free of chemical pesticides or grown without conventional fertilizers.|p
Product taste, concerns for the environment and the desire to avoid foods from genetically engineered organisms are among the many other reasons some consumers prefer to buy organic food products.|p
In 2007 it was estimated that over 60 per cent of consumers bought some organic products.|0
Approximately five per cent of consumers are considered to be core organic consumers who buy up to 50 per cent of all organic food.|0
Err, I’d go with organic.|0
Not if you live in the US though “Organic” is meaningless in the US.|n
There is zero difference in taste or health from organic food but “real” organic food is substantially better for wildlife that live in the fields where your vegetables are grown.|p
Anyway I like field mice more than my friend so I’m going for organic.|p
Every field needs fertilizer organic or synthetic and or micro nutrients.|0
While were on it I would also argue organic animal husbandry equal cruelty.|p
"Heck noboby believes in ""organic"" medicine for humans do they?"|n
What is organic farming?|0
Lets define exactly what “organic farming” means.|0
It really boils down to what “organic” methods are being used to produce food, fiber, energy.|0
Definition #1“Organic meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.|p
Organic food is produced without using most conventional pesticides; fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge; bioengineering; or ionizing radiation.|0
Before a product can be labeled ‘organic,’ a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA organic standards.|0
Companies that handle or process organic food before it gets to your local supermarket or restaurant must be certified, too.” Consumer Brochure, USDA National Organic Program.|0
(Or in the case of animal husbandry, organic non-GMO corn and soy is substituted for conventionally raised corn and soy and no antibiotics/hormones used.)|0
This is the lowest quality version of organic and while you do have fewer pesticide residues and fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens, the nutritional quality is usually very close to the same.|n
This is the lowest quality version of organic and while you do have fewer pesticide residues and fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens, the nutritional quality is usually very close to the same.|p
On the other hand this version of organic really was invented to meet certain regulatory guidelines and many organic growers don’t even consider it “organic” at all.|p
Just a cheap imitation of organic designed to command a higher price at market and meet that consumer demand.|n
I personally call this “substitution organic”, and its main benefit is that a farmer can convert to this easily without much in the way of new training or equipment.|n
Others have termed this Organic 101, or phase 1 organic, the bare minimum basics.|0
Definition #2 “Organic agriculture is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity.|0
It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain and enhance ecological harmony.” USDA National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) definition, April 1995 This definition more closely resembles what organic meant prior to the government and the certification boards taking control.|0
And much faster than “substitution organic”.|0
Others have called this Organic 201 or phase 2 Organic.|0
It is what most people think of when they use the term “organic” as it applies to food, even if what they really are getting is definition #1 above.|0
This organic usually sustainable , but not always, mainly due to externalities.|0
You might find “Organic”, “Beyond Organic”, “Biointensive”, “EcoOrganic”, “EcoAg”, “Permaculture” etc or any number of other newly invented terms all falling under the broader umbrella of “Organic”.|0
This type of organic is often on the cutting edge and is heavily reliant on systems science, holism and biomimicry.|0
So some farmers practising this, most notably Joel Salatin and Gabe Brown, don’t even call themselves “organic”.|0
In almost all cases this type of organic is hugely more nutritious than conventional.|p
This is Organic 301 or phase 3 organic.|0
This is basically the general goal of organic though, no matter what name or definition is used.|0
In India, there are numerous online grocery stores but very few offer quality services and products.|n
Spencer’s is one of those very few reliable online grocery store offering good organic food online.|0
The store offers wide range of daily need products like fresh fruits and vegetables online, non-veg items, household items and organic food items like organic staples.|0
Thumps up for Spencer’s services.|p
THE INITIATIVE Terragreens are an organic food producing company based in Hyderabad that believes in the concept of natural food, or simply - as nature intended.|p
Bonterra Vineyards makes wines organically, and offers quality wines from many varietals at moderate prices.|p
Many French wines from Burgundy are made according to biodynamique methods, which goes way beyond organic standards.|p
In Chicago, I mostly go to Mariano's and Whole Foods Market.|p
When I am in New Zealand, I go to Commonsense Organics in Wellington.|p
Most supermarkets these days carry some organic foods, but if you want more than milk or a couple of smaller items, it helps to go somewhere that specializes.|0
We used to get deliveries from an organic co-op in Wellington.|0
The quality of their produce seemed to be higher and things were often fresher.|p
Sometimes organic produce sits on the shelves in supermarkets for a long time.|0
Many Organic Stores offers 24Mantra, which is a leading brand in India.|0
However, many new brands are offering quality organic products.|p
You can also find list of organic stores in India in OrganicRooster.com|0
It is very tough to say they are 100% organic.|n
To the some extent you can trust the organic certification.|p
There is no way to find out that vegetable vendors who claim that the vegetable are grown under organic conditions.|n
For Organic Farming info Read : HERE.|0
Emphasis on organic and non-processed foods.|p
I do not consider Whole Foods to be a natural food store (although this is subjective since there are currently no guidelines for what is/isn't considered 'natural'), but they definitely carry the most natural choices available for a given product.|p
"When it comes to Organic there arises ""Certification by competent authorities."""|n
In India, seeds are considered sacred and still there are people who never sell their seeds but SHARE their seeds with other farmers.|0
Why should there be a regulation on organic farming is a question asked but never answered.|n
There are various websites for buying organic food online.|0
"You could just as easily say that organic farming methods are ""normal"" and the use of pesticides is not."|p
On organic/non-organic: You are aware that both systems of food production (at least in the United States) use chemicals, derived from raw sources or synthesised.|p
There is also the notion that food without “chemicals” is pure, when there are vegetables that can kill or harm people that have been bred conventionally.|n
Which ironically, is the same pesticide used in organic produce.|n
Typically, the yield is less for organic crops.|n
Organic crops can only utilize natural IPPM methods and natural fertilizers.|0
The cost difference between the two farming practices may very, but the yield for organic farms never matches traditional farming.|n
Organic foods may cost less to produce, but that is not a significant reason for the higher price.|n
With organic crops, the ability to predict the yield reduces, and the final yield itself is dramatically reduced, if it were the same price, he would make much less profit from organic crops.|n
If people demand organic foods, the farmer needs an incentive to grow organic.|0
Farmers are essentially businessmen.|0
They grow crops with the intention of making money.|0
When they consider what to plant, the potential profit is a huge factor in the decision.|0
Organic crops will yield at least 30%-50% less than the same crop that is treated with chemicals.|n
That means that the farmer could potentially make half the profit of the conventional crop.|n
Since there are people who demand organic food, the farmer can justify doubling the cost of an organic crop.|0
What the farmer risks is chemical residue from other fields contaminating his organic crop.|0
If that happens, it can no longer be considered organic and he loses the price increase without gaining the benefits of the chemicals.|0
Organic farmers have a pretty stressful job, and they should be compensated for that.|0
If people are willing to spend more for organic, a farmer will take the risk involved as long as there is an increased profit that goes with it.|p
(I use the quotes because it a silly term) it is expensive and no more nutritious than conventionally grown foods, though it does contain much lower levels of pesticide and herbicides, which I suspect one does not want to ingest a lot of.|n
(I use the quotes because it a silly term) it is expensive and no more nutritious than conventionally grown foods, though it does contain much lower levels of pesticide and herbicides, which I suspect one does not want to ingest a lot of.|p
If, however, you have the wealth to shop for everything in the organic market, I see nothing wrong with that.|p
I think organic food is more expensive per unit to produce because the pesticides and herbicides used in modern farming (along with the mechanization) allow for more units to be produced per allotted space.|n
So an acre of land farmed using modern practices may result in a greater bounty than an acre of land farmed organically.|n
Another aspect is there is some degree of over pricing because people perceive greater value in organic food, and they are willing to pay for it.|n
As owner of a business selling natural and organic products, I know I have competitors pricing products much higher than their costs of production.|n
"""Organic"" pesticides try to take advantage of the ""natural"" pesticides."|0
The good reasons revolve around trying to grow the plant in an environment close to the one it evolved in.|0
And it involves a lot of human labor, not easily mechanized, because mechanization works best in monocultures and the whole point is to avoid monoculture.|0
that is actual organic farming: the term was coined for the organic farmer , who is not a machine.|0
"The rest of ""organic"", as a USDA certified label, is the bad reasons."|0
They involve adapting the original organic idea and trying to scale it up.|0
"Which, to get back to the point of the question, means taking those ""natural"" pesticides, concentrating them, and applying them to vast monocultures."|0
"""Organic"" farming does indeed use pesticides, and they are every bit as toxic as the artificial pesticides."|n
"Not everything ""natural"" is good."|n
And most of what you read on the topic of organic farming, both for and against, is very bad.|n
"Here's the deal: organic food is not lower in ""toxins""."|n
"You do need to get over your fear of ""chemicals"" because it is ALL chemicals."|0
Organic farming is slightly better for the land and the farmers than the even worse offenders in industrial processing, if only because the higher margins slightly reduce the incentives to commit environmental and labor atrocities.|p
"It does not matter if that TV dinner is ""organic"" or not because it is been so highly processed to cram it full of extra tasty calories, fats, sugars, etc."|p
The industrial versions of organic are slightly less destructive.|0
Do that, and you will do better for both your health and the environment.|p
"After that, the difference between ""organic"" and regular industrial conventional is minor."|0
While many people believe that food grown organically is better for you, they may not be able to tell you exactly why it is better for you.|0
The absence of pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables is a fairly obvious benefit but there are more other far-reaching advantages of going organic.|p
"This raises a question ""WHY ORGANICS ARE BETTER""[1] The big-picture benefits have been discovered and documented by the Rodale Institute with an in-depth, long-term study."|p
The Farming Systems Trial:registered: The Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania, USA, has been doing research on organic growing practices for over 60 years.|0
A little over 30 years ago, they decided to do an in-depth comparison study to determine just how beneficial organic farming really is.|0
The study, known as the Farming Systems Trial:registered:, monitored three different nutrient-adding systems: A manure-based system that adds nutrients with animal manure and cover crops or “green manure.” A legume-based system that improves the soil with legumes or “green manure.” A conventional chemical fertilizer-based system.|0
Their findings were published in 2011.|0
The organic manure-based and legume-based system yields were equal to the conventional system under normal growing conditions.|0
During periods of moderate drought, the organic system yields surpassed the conventional system.|p
Environmental Impact The environmental impact of the organic systems was far less than that of the conventional system.|p
Soil in the areas that were farmed organically was improved overall by the nitrogen-fixing legumes or “green manure” and animal manure.|0
It retained more moisture for the plants, resulting in less runoff and water pollution.|0
This increase in moisture retention also contributed to the larger yields during drought conditions.|0
Economic Impact The positive economic impacts of organic farming practices were made clear with the Farming Systems Trial:registered:.|0
Manual labor used in organic farming increases employment opportunities, producing 30% more jobs with each hectare of land farmed.|0
Energy used to maintain the manure-based- and legume-based-system crops was 45% less than with crops raised using conventional farming practices.|p
Profits from organically grown crops were either the same as or greater than those from crops grown with conventional methods.|0
They were even more profitable when the conventional-farming premiums were added to the cost.|p
You may also want to read Five Reasons to Make the Big Switch to Organic Food Footnotes [1] WHY ORGANICS oFarm Organic Grocers|p
Organic farming techniques, as now practiced, produce on average half as much per acre as conventional crops.|0
Depending on the crop, the actual yield is 10% to 85% that of a conventionally farmed crop.|0
At the moment, we can produce just a bit more food than is necessary to feed the current population (using the current mix of organic and conventional farming), but we cannot distribute it effectively to that population, so people starve.|0
It affects the world's poor negatively.|n
Not just because of lower yields and lack of access to synthetic inputs but the organic movement's agitation to keep farmers from accessing the latest technology and science.|n
The subsistence farmers in Africa using traditional methods are essentially organic farmers and it is with joy that the organic movement keeps them using these methods, keeping them in perpetual poverty.|n
The organic movement is also fighting to keep solutions like Golden Rice from poor farmers, making it guilty of millions of blind and dead.|n
"USDA-FDA.com Nutritional Labeling, USDA Label Expeditor, Facility Consultant, UPC Barcodes The USDA defines certain criteria for food sold in the US with the label ""Organic""."|0
It essentially states that the farmers used natural manure instead of processed chemical fertilizers, uses pest management techniques that do not rely on lab-made pesticides and herbicides, and use livestock disease management practices that are not reliant on antibiotics.|p
However, the USDA makes no claims, and in fact states that there is no evidence, to whether or not organic food is healthier, safer, or more nutritious.|0
From first hand experience, I can tell you that organic vegetables are more likely to have pest damage.|n
The first time I bought organic, I bought a zucchini, and sliced it in half right through a worm that had apparently been living inside it.|n
People have a common perception that organic vegetables are larger and healthier, but this is due to selection bias.|n
Grocery stores that sell a lot of organic vegetables tend to be more expensive and have tighter selection criteria.|p
I regularly attend one of the largest farmer-only farmer's markets in the US, and the organic crops are typically pitiful compared to the commercially fertilized ones.|n
Why would commercial growers pay for all the research and development that goes into commercial fertilizers if they could make bigger and better vegetables with cow crap?|n
"There have also been some high profile news cases lately where ""organic"" farms turned out to be getting a lot of runoff from traditional commercial farms."|n
Until just a couple of years ago, there was no regulation at all and anyone could call their produce organic.|0
My advice is that if you are really worried about the quality of your produce, stop buying into marketing hype and get to know your local farmers.|p
Local and Organic foods typically give you more nutrition for the buck...but be sensible.|p
it is better to choose a locally grown green vegetable at the farmers market from a farmer who does not have an organic certification than to get a vegetable flown in from the other side of the world with the organic label.|n
Too many nutrients are lost in the process.|n
Plus, it is not sustainable environmentally.|n
When eating whole, seasonal and local foods, it is of course better to choose gluten-free IF you are battling or want to avoid health issues such as autoimmunity.|0
Organic farming largely refers to growing crops without use of inorganic chemical pesticides or even inorganic nutrients.|p
Organic farming for entire mankind appears to me to be unviable.|n
So organic farming is meant to feed those elite among humans, who would like to escape the genetic impacts of nature devastation triggered by human interventions.|n
May be over a few thousand years, such populations who could continuously afford and consume such organic foods may out survive rest of human race, alternatively humans might adopt genetically to all evil impacts of adversities.|n
Food miles is not the only reason why organic is sometimes more environmentally destructive.|n
Other reasons can include lower efficiency (which means more acres of land used for production), and organic pesticides (which are sometimes worse than the non-organic equivalents).|n
Foreign do-gooders taught sustainable agriculture technique.|0
Yes, this is apparent in Cuban public health statistics.|p
It is very labor-intensive, as anyone who maintains even a small garden will testify.|p
I would like to look at it positively as I have the following facts to substantiate the same.I belong to Chennai and we are seeing a big number of organic stores sprouting up in the city.|0
There are more than 350 new organic stores covering every nook and corner of the city.|0
Even though they do face issues like scarcity of vegetable and fruit supplies, they are doing good on the groceries part.|0
We have also seen web portals exclusive for organic products entering the market with heavy investments.|0
All these are clear indications that the Organic Industry is making solid gains in the market.|p
More and more people has started searching for organic and natural alternatives.|0
Organic gardening in terraces has now become a trend not only among housewives, but also are being tried by professionals from the corporate sector.|p
The commitment of State as well as Central Governments has been so promising that lot of conventional farmers are now stepping into organic farming practices.|0
“National Project on Organic Farming (NPOF) is a continuing central sector scheme since 10th Five Year Plan.|0
The scheme is continuing in the 12th Plan.NPOF is being implemented by National Centre of Organic Farming at Ghaziabad and its six Regional Centres at Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Panchkula, Imphal, Jabalpur and Nagpur.|0
Besides working for realisation of targets under NPOF, NCOF and RCOFs are also performing specific roles in promotion of organic farming.|p
”Ref: National Centre of Organic Farming New packages released by different governments promise subsidies or agri loans with very minimal interest rates to support organic farming.|p
For the first time India's organic farmers are getting introduced to fair trade practices and their profits has increased by 20% to 40%.|p
Also new innovations in better and more effective organic fertilisers and pesticides has replaced the costly chemical based counterparts and increased the yield by more than 30% to 125%.|p
India’s farming lands, once poisoned by heavy usage of pesticides is getting repaired and returned through natural and organic farming methods.|p
Terrace gardening has become a trend now and governments are committed for any support to make this happen.|p
Private Participation is gaining pace in tying up with farmer and farmer producer companies in helping them with the right organic farming practices and promising the farmers a fair price for all their products.|0
Government of Tamilnadu has now come up with distribution of organic grow bags andorganic pesticides at a very reasonable rate.|p
The programme has reached the urban crowd to a great extend, thus making it a beginning towards greener houses, better being, healthier hobbies and an added reason for rain water harvesting.|p
Day by day the awareness towards the need of going organic is increasing which has resulted in more and more farmers joining the organic farming revolution.|p
From my earlier post Raj Kiran's answer to Do you think that organic farming will create a dominance in the world in the coming years?|p
"However, a number of studies found that organic meats had less antibiotic resistance, which has environmental implications because greater resistance to antibiotics could lead to more dangerous ""super-bugs""."|p
At the same time, the research shows that organics tend to have more contaminants, such as e-coli.|n
In my views organic farming having great demand in India.|p
Organic farming having to great advantages as the crops is harvested is very healthy for the human health.|p
It increase the soil fertility as the soil amendments are use for cultivating organic crop.|0
No use of any chemical increase the market value of the particular crop So it shows that in future its is necessary do organic for soil and human health point of view.|n
Organic farming having not that much potential to feed upcoming population in future.|n
For one thing, the quality of the water used in farming is not regulated under organic certification.|n
I would definitely recommend organic milk over any super market milk.|p
Organic certification is a very stringent process that ensures not only the product but also the farmland is free of prohibited synthetic chemicals, gmo etc.|p
A long term use of these synthetic chemicals can be very harmful for the gut bacteria in human gut.|p
A healthy gut bacteria is cornerstone of a healthy life.|p
There is lot of new research linking various disease to gut bacteria imbalance.|p
Yes organic farming is more sustainable than regular farming methods.|p
Organic farming is a safer and healthier practice because it makes use of the wastes from farms and gardens to fertilize the soil, instead of using the artificial fertilizers which contain harmful chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, etc.|p
Organic farming methods do not involve intensive farming practices like single cropping which is practiced in regular farming.|0
The pesticides used in organic method of farming is less toxic, is more natural containing nutrients, microbes, etc.|0
This also helps in reducing wastes from farming land as all the wastes are utilized in increasing soil fertility, thus, making t environment friendly.|p
Consider that there are myriad varieties of natural pest control measures used by organic-certified farms including oil-based suffocants, which - granted - are a fair bit more expensive than conventional pesticides, but work equally well.|0
Remember, you are paying a premium for organic food because of the absence of synthetic fertilisers, chemical sprays, insecticides and pesticides, among other measures.|0
Nevertheless, organic foods are generally still sprayed for the sake of crop preservation, with substances on an 'permitted' list.|0
The real argument for eating organic food is that it is an alternative to a food system that is unsustainable and damaging to ecosystems, farm workers, fresh water, and pretty much all of the resources we require to survive.|n
A lot has been made about people eating organic to be healthy but there are a lot of ways to be healthy.|0
There is only one way to grow food that is not completely disrespectful to the land and it is through organic practices.|0
All things considered I would argue that Local food is probably the most healthy choice, in both nutrient content and overall footprint.|p
For example, a conventionally grown tomato from a farmstand down the road not only has a higher nutrient content than an organic one picked unripe in california or florida, but it also did not get packaged and ride in a truck for 2,000 miles to get to your sandwich.|n
I own and run a small diversified vegetable farm using only organic methods.|0
I use no artificial pesticides or fertilizers and try to be as sustainable as possible.|0
Organic certification has largely been co-opted by corporations as a marketing label.|0
It has nothing to do with quality, freshness, nutritional value or even true sustainability.|n
As such anything labeled as organic in the grocery store is more expensive than it should be.|n
This means buy direct from us allows you to buy organic without the extra costs associated with certification or the drive to inflate corporate profits.|p
I do not buy into the whole ecofriendly organic garbage, but I really like their pizza.|n
there is a unique quality to some of their food.|p
They also have a nice selection of macaroons that are not available at safeway.|p
We have clear standards which require certification, something that gives specific meaning to the word organic.|0
Some Americans are willing to pay a premium for organic and it remains to be seen whether that same market will develop in other countries.|p
One of the major pushes of global trade is crop stability in transit but one of the major pushes in organic is fresh and local.|p
So where it is easy to have a ship full of corn moving to markets, it would seem to me that organic fruit and vegetables are more vulnerable to damage in transit.|n
My impression is that for the most part, it does not make a difference.|n
The main place where it really seems to matter is in animal products - dairy and meat.|0
In those cases, aim not for organic but naturally raised.|n
Grass-fed meat and pastured eggs for example.|0
The main reason is that animal products concentrate nutrients and will be far more nutritious.|p
By the same argument, you might also consider organic for oils.|p
Because organic crops have more pests and lower levels of nutrition than non-organic crops, the yield per acre is much lower.|n
Organic growers feed the soil which in turn feeds the plants (through the wondrous and complex activity of microbial soil life).|0
Organic farming aims to strengthen the plants.|p
Well-nourished plants in turn offer more nutrients to the animals and humans who eat the plants.|p
Another organic method is to introduce companion planting.|0
But the most common definition is this: “Organic agriculture is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity.|p
It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain and enhance ecological harmony.” USDA National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) definition, April 1995 This can effect the quality, cost of the food and/or the impact on the environment depending on the methods used.|0
For more information on that look here: Scott Strough's answer to Is organic food more nutritious?|0

Scott Strough's answer to Is organic food better for the environment?|0
Organic food was earlier found only in certain food stores but is now made available in all the supermarkets.|0
So, if you have that dilemma whether to go for organic or inorganic foods, understanding the facts on organic foods can help you with a right shopping from the next time.|0
Healthy Organic Food The “organic” is based on the method employed in producing these vegetables, grains, fruits, dairy products and meat.|0
The main idea behind producing organic foods was to protect the soil and conserve water while reducing pollution.|0
The overall pesticide levels in the organic foods is nearly 10 to 100 times lower than the conventionally produced food.|p
The pesticide residues in the organic foods is 3 to 4 times less likely than in the regular foods.|p
The toxic metals such as cadmium in the organic foods are also relatively low compared to the regular foods.|p
Organic foods such as chicken and pork are less likely to harbor the resistant bacteria and are especially good for children who have lower immune levels.|p
Organic foods also regulate the use of food additives and processing aids such as artificial sweeteners, flavors, and coloring agents.|p
Nutrient Value It is not certain whether organic foods are more nutritious over the inorganic foods.|0
Antioxidant content is nearly 60% higher in the organic fruits, vegetables and grains over the inorganic counterparts.|p
Flavonones which can reduce your risk for stroke are found to be 69% higher in the organic foods over the conventional foods.|p
Organic foods are generally sold to the nearby markets from the place of their harvest and that gives them their extra freshness over the conventional foods.|p
Overall, the nutrient values of organic food are a little higher than inorganic foods.|p
Worth Investing More on Organic Foods The main concern about the organic foods is their cost due to the expensive farming technique.|n
But if you like the idea of low pesticide and the environment-friendly production of organic foods then don’t hold on to having the inorganic foods just to save few pennies.|p
If it is not possible for you to go for 100% organic food, at least replace those inorganic foods which have higher pesticide levels.|p
Organic food is better for the environment, soil and body.|p
More and more shoppers are convinced to buy organic food, and their market is steadily increasing.|0
Pick those products labeled as “organic” and certified by the USDA (US Department of Agriculture), when you shop through the food lanes this time.|0
If this seal is not present, then the product is not 100% organic, and might contain very few organic ingredients.|0
(As a matter of fact, I buy a mix of organic and conventional produce, based on what I can afford and which products have been shown to have the most pesticide residues.)|p
Now, most products that are labelled organic are just that - labelled organic.|n
Anyone can look up the regulations around organic certification, which as you have pointed out, clearly allow for some natural pesticides and a small number of carefully studied and deemed safe synthetic pesticides.|p
I do not often buy organic foods for a few reasons: The jury's still out on the health benefits of organic food.|0
it is often worse for the environment.|n
Here in the U.S. much of our organic produce is shipped to us from other parts of the world, offsetting much of the benefit of reducing chemical run off.|n
If given the choice between local or organic, I will almost always choose local.|p
If given the choice between local or organic, I will almost always choose local.|n
"""Organic"" does not necessarily mean fewer pollutants."|0
And using animal products like manure as fertilizer also carries the risk of disease transmission, so organic produce should still be scrubbed thoroughly before eating it.|0
That being said, there is one type of food I consistently buy organic: milk.|0
I buy organic milk because of the widespread use of antibiotics in dairy cows and the increasing threat of antibiotic-resistant microbes in our environment.|0
But this is a choice I based more on my desire to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial treatment in general rather than any health benefits associated with organic milk.|0
For more information, see : Organic Food Has No Benefits Over Conventional Food, Says Study Are Organic Foods Safer or Healthier Than Conventional Alternatives?|0
: A Systematic Review Nutritional quality of organic foods: a syste... [Am J Clin Nutr.|0
Essentially it means they are using carbon-based chemicals but she had an interesting take on it that came to the same conclusion saying that it definitely does not mean that things labelled organic are better and could even be worse in some ways.|0
So if the water used to irrigate the crops is highly contaminated industrial wastewater full of pollutants and heavy metals, you can still claim the product is organic.|n
If you are seeing organic products from India, I would also be inclined to be sceptical.|n
by buying locally-grown organic, which is not hard to find around here.|0
It is produced according to organic farming principles which are committed to working in harmony with nature rather than against nature.|p
Organic farming works within the natural confines of the farming eco-system to provide you with great tasting food!|p
In practice organic farming; Avoids the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides Requires the highest standards of animal welfare Does not permit the use of genetically modified organisms Uses less fossil fuel energy per calorie of food produced Protects our biodiversity by maintaining suitable habitats for plants, animals and wildlife Encourages people to buy their food locally and in season Source : What is organic food ?|0

It may also the fertilizer they use as most contain harmful chemicals instead of good ol' fashion chicken/animal poop.|n
Sometimes it could be a just a label to push your grocery bills higher.|n
There are many unscrupulous people who simply put a label to earn a profit.|n
I always eat whatever i could afford and supermarket organic is not it anytime soon.|n
"Specific requirements must be met and maintained in order for products to be labeled as ""organic."""|p
Organic crops must be grown in safe soil, have no modifications, and must remain separate from conventional products.|p
Farmers are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, bioengineered genes (GMOs), petroleum-based fertilizers, and sewage sludge-based fertilizers.|p
Organic livestock must have access to the outdoors and be given organic feed.|p
They may not be given antibiotics, growth hormones, or any animal-by-products.|p
Wow sounds healthy but practically is expensive for middle class you can compare the price of organic food products.|n
I do not care, per se, if it is organic or if it is local but it often ends up being so.|p
Sometimes organic producers offer superior or unusual varieties, so I buy their stuff.|p
In terms of safety or nutrition, there is no difference at all.|0
Restaurants and food manufacturers should be required to have safe ingredients and that is all.|0
No special distinction need be made for the source unless they willingly choose to market that in the growing and profitable Organic Food craze.|0
Plenty of natural food sources have dangerous enzymes, acids and chemicals which can be deadly or harmful if not used properly or if not used in moderation.|n
The source of the chemical is not any guarantee as to the overall safety of the chemical.|n
Plenty of natural and organic foods we eat every day have potentially harmful ingredients in varying quantities.|n
Just take your geiger counter to the spice aisle *1 or the fruit aisles and you will see.|n
Most of these are completely harmless in the concentrations we typically encounter.|0
By the same token many common man made chemicals we use every day for medicinal and industrial uses are perfectly safe and even beneficial in low doses (aspirin for example) but deadly in higher concentrations too.|0
Plenty of certified organic ingredients can be harmful in large and small doses.|n
The question is safety not source.|0
Plenty of certified organic pesticides will kill a human as easily as kill a bug.|n
All food ingredients should be tested and fully researched and in America and Europe we have some of the best standards in the world for testing food additives, ingredients and drugs.|0
Admittedly America may be a bit slow to act on potential issues but generally they do get there.|0
We just need more investment in testing the safety of these ingredients.|0
True, the consensus on safe levels can change.|0
As I pointed out in my answer, there are pesticides allowed on organic crops that are known (rather than probable) carcinogens.|n
Are you going to eliminate organic crops from your diet because of their pesticide residues?|n
Based on available science, that actually seems like the safest way to go, and I try to avoid organic produce when shopping.|n
The main reason most people initially begin going organic in their diets is because of health reasons.|0
The production of organic food actually reduces the risks of health problems to the general public.|p
Since organic farms avoid using these chemicals to treat their food, it is much safer overall than regular farming.|p
Organic foods also do not use antibiotics in animal food which can cause people to become more resistant to fighting disease over time.|p
Additionally, organic farms are much safer for their employees to work at since they aren’t exposed from all of these dangerous pesticides and chemicals.|p
Overall, organic farming is so much safer for everyone involved, it simply cannot be disputed.|p
Organic is purely a marketing term.|n
It has absolutely nothing to do with the safety or nutrition of food[1].|n
Any reputable peanut butter in a reasonably regulated food chain will be safe from aflatoxin.|p
Organic is, to be clear, no guarantee that those levels will be safe.|n
Footnotes [1] Boycott the butterfly, and stop buying organic.|n
Organics will usually contain essential oils like tea tree, orange, clove leaf etc.|0
Diatomaceous earth is an organic powder.|0
"People usually think of ""organic"" as no pesticides or chemical fertilizerrs, but it just has to adhere to a list by Federal regulations."|0
"you would be surprised at what qualifies as ""organic"" to the government."|0
I was production manager at a agricultural chemical manufacturer in arizona for 5 years where we produced organic certified and toxic products.|0
"So-called ""organic food"", OTOH, can be not only unhealthy, but dangerous."|n
For instance, if you are allergic to shellfish, so you stay on an organic vegetarian diet, you will probably kill yourself.|n
"what is the ""organic"" fertilizer used in much ""organic"" farming?"|0
Besides, if it is food, it is organic.|0
"You eat things that are, or once were, alive - and that is what ""organic"" means."|0
Growing vegetables using phosphorus that comes from shrimp is no different than growing vegetables using phosphorus that was dug out of some mine - the plant uses the element phosphorus, it does not matter where it came from.|0
"(Except that if they are getting it from ""organic"" shrimp, peanut shells or something else you are allergic to, it could kill you.)"|n
"Eat ""organic"", ""non-GMO"" food full of cholesterol that uses salt to enhance the flavor (both salt and cholesterol are part of an ""organic"" diet, BTW) and you are eating unhealthy food."|n
Organic foods are defined as those that have been grown without using fertilizers or pesticides.|0
Most organic farms, in fact must implement strict guidelines to receive their organic certification.|0
These guidelines are so strict that, for example; farmers may not use any chemically treated wooden stakes when planting; they must keep all machinery free from dust and foreign substances which could contaminate the crops; and must use animal feed that is purely organic in quality.|0
If any one of these contaminates are found in the crops, it renders the while crop ruined.|0
Getting organic certification requires food production that can be certified.|0
Certification requires that growing, storing, processing, packaging, and shipping which include total elimination of such things as chemicals, pesticides; antibiotics; food additives; and such.|0
Also, the farmland has to be free of chemicals for three years; the farmer must keep detailed records; must maintain physical separation of organic products from non-organic products; must have periodic inspections; and are subject to the same agricultural, and safety regulations which govern non-organic farmers.|0
it is not necessary to buy all organic fruits and vegetables if cost is an issue.|0
Here is a list of the Clean 15, ie, fruits and vegetables that bear little to no pesticides: onions avocados sweet corn pineapples mango sweet peas asparagus kiwi fruit cabbage eggplant cantaloupe watermelon grapefruit sweet potatoes sweet onions Then there are the Dirty Dozen, the fruits and vegetables that, if at all possible, should be purchased organic.|0
They are: celery peaches strawberries apples domestic blueberries nectarines sweet bell peppers spinach, kale and collard greens cherries potatoes imported grapes lettuce If you purchase the Dirty Dozen non-organic, make sure that you wash them really well before eating.|0
Eating organic supposedly reduces pollution since potentially harmful chemicals, such as non-organic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, do not end up washing into streams and rivers.|p
If you really want to be ethical with your food, the safest way is to grow your food organically in your back yard.|p
laver and other types of edible seaweed- or take an organic supplement that has the iodine.|p
If it is produced safely, can be applied safely, and will not get into the food stuffs beyond a tolerable level, then it is a candidate for organics.|0
To me, mild to moderate hypothyroidsm may be taken up for natural or the so called organic cure.|p
Take care while depending on organic/natural remedies.|0
As others have said, there are specific programs for organic farmers and there are also programs for farmers markets and various consumer-facing pieces and the largest financial support from the USDA go to hunger relief efforts rather than to farms.|0
Recently a friend who grows organic commodities was telling me about some of the various government programs that have assisted her.|0
From the Scientific American Why does organic milk last so much longer than regular milk?|n
I gather that organic means the farmer does not expose the herd to routine unnecessary antibiotic use, so valuable in avoiding the cow's enteral bacteria developing antibiotic resistance we all so fear.|0
Because of the longer transit times organic milk is heated to a higher temperature killing all bacteria.|0
The common thing that happens when people start to eat more healthy alternatives is that they try to change their diet to a better.|p
As far as I am aware, science has not shown a great difference between organic and non-organic foods.|0
My personal experience with the two is that some food tastes better (tomatoes, chicken).|p
This anecdote really spoke out to me: It sounds all dandy, but one of the girls on that farm had to stop going to English classes because there was too much farm work to do , especially with an organic system.|0
In my view Organic farming may not sustain for too long.|n
with organic farming we cannot match the agriculture growth with that of population growth.|n
As such now it is not possible to check whether the produce has come from organic farming or not.|0
It is not easy to do organic farming because every thing should be organic.|0
In the present situation to fertilize organic farming you need only organic fertilisers like Fym, vermiculture etc.|0
If the area under organic farming increases it is very difficult to get those kind of fertilisers.|n
Organic pesticides are not that effective to control the epidemics.|n
production figures cannot sustain if the organic farming increases.|n
If more and more people opt for organic food Because of its value adulteration with normal food will increase.|p
Common man cannot afford to by organic, food.|n
Actually, no, I don't.|n
At least, I do not have a strong preference for organic food.|n
There was a study done a few months ago and it found that basically, there is slightly more pesticide residue on conventional fruits and vegetables than on organic fruits and vegetables.|p
The washing will take care of the traces of pesticide remaining.|n
While poisoning from pesticides is extremely unlikely, bacterial or parasitic contamination of our food supply is relatively common.|n
All it takes is one episode of food poisoning or one class in parasitology and anyone who thinks about it will be very shy of ordering raw oysters, sashimi, seared tuna, or a rare steak.|n
Nutrients are created by the plant's growth processes and metabolism -- whether the food is grown conventionally or organically does not really do much to change the plant's metabolic processes.|n
A great many peer-reviewed studies have failed to find any health benefit to organic foods over equivalent conventional foods.|n
That goes for both conventional and organic fruit -- the organic stuff does not have as much sprayed on it, but it does have more exposure to illness-causing contaminants like e. coli.|n
And all grocery store fruit is pawed through all day by produce clerks and other shoppers.|n
Note that food wastage is much higher without these pesticides -- organic farming tends to require ~10% more farmland to produce the same final crop due to pest damage.|n
And ripe organic fruit spoils in days rather than weeks.|n
But organic crops are fertilized too -- they are just fertilized with stuff like manure and crop waste.|0
On one hand, this creates a much greater opportunity for transmission of food-borne illness.|n
(This risk seems to offset any possible health gains from organic food.)|n
On the other hand, natural fertilizer contains a wider range of plant nutrients than sterile chemical fertilizer does.|0
This is why some organic produce tastes better than conventional produce.|p
Manure is a really good fertilizer.|p
Anyway, studies have shown that organic foods offer little/no health benefit over the same conventional produce.|n
that is a pretty good sign that they do not contain more nutrients.|n
I mean, they could, but it would have to be a minuscule improvement below the detection threshold of scientific studies.|n
And if the difference is too small to be statistically detectable, I really do not think we should worry too much about it.|n
There are a few cases where organic food probably is better: I personally think organic bananas taste a little better than regular bananas.|p
(Not enough to pay more for them, but still.)|p
If you are making orange or lemon zest, you should use organic fruit to avoid the fungicides and fruit dyes used on citrus skins.|p
If you really hate wax on your apples, it is easier to buy organic apples than clean conventional ones.|p
it is not fruit, but organic milk lacks some antibiotics and hormones that have been linked to health effects in humans.|n
Sometimes, organic farmers just care more about the quality of their crops than conventional mass-market farmers.|0
But perhaps more often, grocery stores buy higher-quality organic produce than conventional produce because the organic stuff is significantly higher-margin and they want you to buy more of it.|0
In general , there is not much benefit to organic food.|n
But there are some exceptions.|0
'Organic farming' has a future in India, but it is not the future of agriculture in India.|n
As Rajeev Saxena also observes we got to have a reliable 'certification system' in place so that the consumers do not keep guessing about the quality of the products they shall pay as organic.|n
A.S Ramprasad has rightly pointed out that in 'organic farming' there is drastic decline in yields.|n
Even in this practices like 'integrated pest management' (that includes biocontrol agents) complementary use of organic manures etc shall help.|p
Prudent approach is that we do not always think in terms of 'absolute organic' or vice versa practice.|0
In case the champions of organic agriculture accept full blast use of genetically engineered crops to be in the 'organic domain' then a host of insecticides, fungicides, weedicides can be dispensed with and large-scale availability of non-toxic food may become a reality for all in the foreseeable future.|0
"""Low Budget"" and ""Health Food Store"" probably do not go together at all!"|0
There is usually a huge mark-up on prices for anything labelled 'organic' or 'natural'.|n
Instead, investigate co-ops in your area, city farms, markets and so on.|p
Co-ops are where a group of people get together and buy their food in bulk, then distribute it, sharing costs - everyone gets it a bit cheaper.|0
City farms are just what they sound like - a farm, often in your city, where people have grown fruit and vegies and herbs, usually organic.|0
Often these city farms have a weekly market, but markets are everywhere nowadays and can have the freshest, best quality foods straight from the producers without the markup you see in supermarkets or commercial stores (of course, find a proper market, not a 'trendy' one).|0
Foods that are touted to be 'all natural' or 'organic' are not necessarily better or even good for you.|n
Go for foods as untouched by humans as possible and learn how to make the things you like to eat from scratch.|0
Organic food generally tastes better.|p
Unfortunately, at this point most food labeled organic is done so primarily as a marketing strategy, as the trendiness of organic food has been largely co-opted by business interests and Big Ag.|n
Most organic food sold in large retail outlets is grown very similarly to the conventional alternatives, with negligible differences concerning the ecological or social impacts, and questionable health gains to the consumer (the Internet is full of studies both professing and denying the healthfulness of organic over conventional.|p
Most organic food sold in large retail outlets is grown very similarly to the conventional alternatives, with negligible differences concerning the ecological or social impacts, and questionable health gains to the consumer (the Internet is full of studies both professing and denying the healthfulness of organic over conventional.|n
I encourage anyone to do their own research, check their sources accordingly, and make their own judgements.|0
Full disclosure: I am an organic farmer, I know where I stand).|p
Organic food in the original sense of the term arose from a very real concern shared by many people for the quality and healthfulness of their food and the system of industrial agriculture that produces it.|p
In a deeper sense of the term, the growing popularity of Organic food reflects the desire of many people to eat food that is grown responsibly and thoughtfully, that among other things might involve care for animals and their well being, care for the people that do the work, concern for what happens downstream of the farm, interest in building and maintaining dynamic and sustainable rural communities, and/or the desire to create systems of agriculture that can endure into the indefinite future (...since our current system of industrial agriculture cannot).|p
What this gets at is that the growing of organic food is not just concerned with the health or quality of a carrot or an egg but rather in the process strives to build health in bigger ways too: that of the soil, of the farmer, of farm animals, of wild animals, of the farmer's community, of the consumer that he relies on, of biodiversity in general (for the earth's own sake, if not the various ecological services it provides, such as pollinators and other sorts of beneficial insects), of all people.|p
Unfortunately, even most people who seek organics are primarily concerned with the quality of what food goes into their body and less so with those other, more abstract things.|p
So yes, organic as it stands is mostly just a marketing gimmick.|n
(ask me if it interests you how it can be more than that)|p
So, unfortunately, I do not think there is a big impact yet, and lifestyle-driven chronic disease (heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, strokes, cancers, joint problems and pain, mood disorders, etc.)|n
I do like the direction of organic and healthier, whole foods.|p
I also think those who choose those foods will benefit with better health and less disease!|p
I run an organic food company and I agree with most of the points in the source article above.|0
We make frozen food so I am biased, but I disagree with Sonnet that buying organic frozen food does not matter.|0
If you want to eat organic fresh vegetables, why would not you want to eat organic frozen vegetables?|0
The article states that organic wild seafood is a misnomer, which is true, but I believe that eating wild seafood is much better for you than eating farmed seafood - for example because mercury levels are typically much higher in farmed seafood.|n
I would recommend buying wild (and therefore not organic) salmon over organic farmed salmon.|n
I make my choices on organic vs non organic based on price and pragmatism.|0
I am willing to pay a premium for organic, but not 2x and I am willing to pay a greater premium for vegetables, fruits and berries than I am for nuts and grains.|0
Meta studies also show no benefits from organic.|0
Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds|0
Now, given that organic foods are not very strictly policed, and that most GMOs other than Monsanto corn do release pollen, I would guess that there is some cross breeding here or there.|0
Organic growers are generally smaller farms.|0
it is got nothing to do with whether GMO's are safe or organic is better or worse.|0
The former is created strictly for yield, pest and disease resistance, the latter is gown to be as healthy as possible, (to increase yield, pest and disease resistance) You need rich, good dirt to grow organic, and the plants reflect that in nutritional quality.|p
TL/DR: There are no good reasons to believe that eating organic has any meaningful benefits for your heath or the environment when compared to conventional agriculture.|n
long version: Depending on what you are eating, where and how it is grown and numerous other factors, there could be some benefit to choosing organic over conventional.|p
However in in different situations there are benefits of choosing conventional over organic.|n
Given the large number of crops, cropping systems and possible forms of harm (e.g.|0
soil erosion, water contamination, carbon efficiency, habitat loss) I feel it is probably a wash.|0
"In all ""it depends"", but there is probably no benefit on the whole."|n
Health wise there is no real benefit.|n
Though organic produce typically has slightly higher mineral and vitamin contents than conventionally grown produce, the diffence is slight and can be compensated for by eating slightly more fruit, which you can afford more easily by not buy organic.|p
Though organic produce typically has slightly higher mineral and vitamin contents than conventionally grown produce, the diffence is slight and can be compensated for by eating slightly more fruit, which you can afford more easily by not buy organic.|n
Organic producers use pesticides too ( Page on xerces.org and pesticides in Organic Farming ) and these pesticides are likely no less harmful to the environment or human health.|n
Daniel's answer says that organic produce contains less heavy metals, but without some legitimate sources to back that claim, I would assume that heavy metal concentrations would be similar.|n
a good overview is found here: Mythbusting 101: Organic Farming > Conventional Agriculture|n
Mostly anything in the produce, dairy and meat department can be purchased organic.|p
If you aren’t sure just go to a natural food store and look for anything that say’s organic and Non-GMO on it and you will be safer.|p
Going organic is not easy, I started with my milk, then went to Free Range eggs which is better than caged.|p

Organic food is not healthier: Stanford U.|n
Why Organic Food May Not Be Healthier For You However, in many, many cases, organic food is going to have a worse impact on the environment.|n
Can eating locally, organically hurt the environment?|0
The most obvious fact, in my opinion, is the average cost of organic food over regular food.|0
With a quick glance at this chart: Organic Versus Non-Organic; Store Versus Farmers’ Market One can see that the price of organic food is significantly higher, in many cases over 80%.|0
TL;DR: spend the money on directly helping the environment instead of buying organic.|n
Except on the basis of cost, for those who cannot afford to pay a premium for certified organic goods.|n
That study was performed by an openly pro-organic advocacy group.|0
We should look at science by third parties, not advocacy groups.|0
"Yes: organic farmers can still use herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides so long as they are ""organic""."|0
Yes: organic farms are held to higher standards of environmental stewardship.|p
While certainly not perfect, the more we can do to protect our rapidly deteriorating topsoil, the better.|p
No: organic foods have not been shown to be more nutritious than conventional ones.|0
Yes: organic foods have been shown to contain significantly less pesticides of all kinds than conventional ones Yes: some pesticides have been shown to be harmful The fact is, we do not know everything about health, and we never will.|0

They may have bought the organic farms where they source their produce, or started their own organic farms, and would have had to do so on a very large scale.|0
That is has more of a limited supply than conventional produce?|0
Organic produce, in my experience, is not more finite than conventional produce, especially with more and more organic farms coming to be.|0
You can get most any type of produce anytime of the year from different sources, usually having to source from other parts of the country or import from other countries all together to get what is not in season here (USA).|p
This can be done both with conventional and organic produce.|0
Sure, in urban areas there are plenty of natural food stores.|p
Prices are obviously higher than non-organic but still affordable, unless you have a huge appetite or large family to feed.|p
Access to organic food.|0
My food is cheaper than organic food at the store.|0
The products must have organic certification in order to call themselves as organic.|0
Welcome to APEDA The bodies that provide organic certification must be accredited under NPOP (National Programme for organic production) from APEDA.|0
The bodies which are accredited under NPOP from APEDA only have the rights to give an organic certification for the agricultural products.|0
The bodies which are not accredited under APEDA have no rights to provide organic certification in India.|0
"To know the name of the bodies/agencies which provide organic certification under APEDA open the link below, <URL>"" These bodies can give organic certification to any food products."|0
You ask shops to show the organic certificate to know that their products are organic or not.|0
With no certification then also the products may be organic but it is difficult to know.|n
There are many organic stores in Bangalore, you can Google search but I have explained how to know that the products are organic or not.|0
The organic market is currently booming in India.|p
People specially in Chennai and Bangalore are moving towards organic products.|p
The best part of the organic trade is that you will have people ready to buy your products and stock them too.|p
Organic is a niche market.|p
So let's say your product is Organic Milk.|0
There are niche sites that customers in India visit to like Page on greenngood.com , Page on orgaicshop.in , etc that stock such products.|p
Similarly there are many retail outlets that stock exclusive organic products only.|p
This helps as the customer knows the value of Organic product and you do not have to struggle with competition from non organic ones.|p
Also, If I do understand the question correctly you are just starting an organic farm currently and are not sure of the product.|0
In this case too, your produce will sell as currently organic market is at a boom.|p
For organic Tees, you van visit us at Indophile We recently had a stall at Green Bazaar in Chennai and the response was just tremendous.|p
Yes everyone want to buy organic foods then it does not matter buying it online or going on the shop.|0
I myself buy organic products online mostly from tradus.com at affordable rates in India.|p
Organic is mainstream, so while you may not find organic fruit in late night corner shops (convenience shops) you will find it in almost every other shop that sells fruit and veg, from dedicated grocers to every supermarket chain.|0
there are lots of farmers shops run by farmers (organic ) , make sure the produce is yours . |p

To avoid the normal allotted amount of pesticides the FDA normally appoves 2.|p
Preference for animals that are fed their natural feed (cows naturally eat grass not corn) 4.|p
To avoid the added antibiotics and hormones.|p
Taste preference 6.|0
Some consumers are keeping tract with research that supports the health benefits of an organic diet as well as research and numerous documentaries that explain the potential health risks of a diet consisting of primarily GMOs and processed foods.|p
Ignore the smear campaign that is funded by Big Organic.|0
(They want to distract you from the fact that organic food is not actually healthier.)|n
Agreed that there is no inherent link between non-organic and processing.|0
But it would be really interesting to see good studies on the soy-breast cancer link.|0
Particularly if stats for American women who eat unprocessed or minimally processed American soy look more like those of Japanese women eating Japanese soy.|0
But I doubt that is going to happen - either processed food manufacturers or GMO companies will take a big hit.|0
Organic certainly does not just mean home-grown.|n
There are organic pesticides and fertilizers, and if you use them, and refrain from adding manufactured chemicals, or using GMO plants or non-organic or chemically-treated seeds, or growing your vegetables in soils that have been fertilized with non-organic materials for three or more years, then you can claim your vegetables are equivalent to organic vegetables . |n
As a private grower, you are not eligible for certification of your produce as organic.|n
Another perspective: there is no such thing as organic wine.|n
Organic grape-growing is a thing.|p
If you are committed to consuming organic products, there are a good many quite tasty wines made from organic grapes, although I would steer you clear of domestic products and brands that are designed expressly to take advantage or your predilections and beliefs.|p
If you are committed to consuming organic products, there are a good many quite tasty wines made from organic grapes, although I would steer you clear of domestic products and brands that are designed expressly to take advantage or your predilections and beliefs.|n
Instead, I would point you at major European growers and vintners who subscribe to biodynamic practices.|p
Not, mind you, because I think these practices are scientifically sound.|p
A lot of biodynamic agriculture is superstition.|n
But many of those vintners can make a great bottle of wine!|p
He is absolutely incorrect in suggesting that extra pesticides or herbicides are used.|p
It is a patently false assertion which shows supreme ignorance of what the certification process involves.|p
How do organic farmers get rid of aphids?|0
They are not pesticide and chemical free, they are grown with “organic approved” pesticides and chemicals, which is code for “untested”.|n
Mythbusting 101: Organic Farming > Conventional Agriculture|n
If I had to restrict my tea diet to only those that are 'certified organic', my soul would be crushed, a far worse consequence in my opinion.|0
I read certified organic to mean farmers who cut costs elsewhere to pay for the certification fees and/or are being courted by Western vendors.|0
Farmers and local vendors generally do not bother about organic certification, even if the teas are actually 'organic'.|0
Since I do not generally buy from Western vendors, I do not care very much for teas that are certified organic.|0
There is little point in consuming a poor quality tea that has been certified organic.|0
The main disadvantage IS government regulation and how that relates to economies of scale.|0
Farms large and small that exist to distribute food publicly have so many federal regulations on them that the small farmer really struggles to survive these days.|0
Regulation fees are far out of whack for small farmers who often have to pay the same rates as giant corporate farms.|0
The government has nearly regulated the small local farmer out of business.|0
This is the most notable in organic food which must pay extra regulation fees to use the term “organic”.|0
People think organic food is more expensive because of the scale and business model of the small farmer.|0
The main reason organic food costs more is because of the fees the federal government charges to use the term organic.|0
These fees eat so deep into the small farmers profit lines that they end up needing to charge higher prices to survive.|0
Have no doubt about it - the main disadvantage a local farmer has is the federal government applying high regulation fees that only corporate farms can afford and still make a good living.|n
"No country produces ""mostly"" Certified Organic Food."|0
"(e.g.,, to use US standards, food that contains only organic ingredients, or is ""made with"" at least 70% organic ingredients)."|0
Organic has a lot of different definitions and standards and levels associated with it.|0
A lot of farms meet all the organic criteria, but do not want to go through the expense of being certified.|0
"That said, the only/best global data we have is based on ""certified organic"" farms."|0
** You can see here, the countries with the highest percent of certified organic agricultural land.|0
"Source: <URL>"" Of course, organic agricultural land does not equate with production."|0
"Here are the countries with the highest number of organic producers: <URL>"" And, of course, production does not equate with consumption."|0
For example, in a lot of Latin American countries, over 85% of organic produce is exported.|0
"** If we are not looking at ""certified organic"" agriculture, Cuba would actually come pretty close to meeting the standard of ""mostly"" organic food (see starting pg 198 here for an interesting discussion <URL>"" )."|0
I wanted to explain the difference between whole foods and organic whole foods.|0
Let’s compare something like regular chicken with organic free range chicken.|0
The problem with the term organic is that it is ambiguous.|n
Organic does not necessarily mean the animal is treated humanely or free to roam around.|0
Ideally, you probably want your chicken to go out and peck and live a healthy life, but that’s not a guarantee with organic foods.|0
The term has enough ambiguity where farmers can manipulate the interpretation of it.|n
While an organic food should theoretically be more nutritious, since they are not pumped with hormones and pesticides, the rules are so vague that it’s not a guarantee you’re getting food that is of significantly higher quality.|p
While an organic food should theoretically be more nutritious, since they are not pumped with hormones and pesticides, the rules are so vague that it’s not a guarantee you’re getting food that is of significantly higher quality.|0
There are certifying bodies in all countries that certify and ensure the authenticity of organic produce.|p
Know the certifying bodies for your country and what they do and do not allow.|p
Famrers pay for their produce to be certified.|0
In many countries the words 'organic', 'bio', and 'biologically' are legally regulated.|0
Meaning of 'bio' and 'organic'Since you used the word 'bio' in your question I suspect you are from Europe, because both 'bio' and 'biological' are used in many EU-countries (with a Latin or Germanic language) to refer to what native-English speakers call organic food.|0
I assume that with 'bio' you mean 'organic' and not bio-based products.|0
Basically an organic label on a food is a guarantee that the food was produced according to organic farming principles.|0
This means that production was done using sustainable methods and with ecological balance, animal welfare and maintaining biodiversity in mind.|p
Organic food in EuropeFood in EU-member states may only contain the words 'bio', 'biological' or 'organic' if specific regulations are followed in its production and if the producer has been certified by the proper authorities.|0
Here are some of the main rules for organic foods in the EU: No use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers in production, only a small list of naturally-occurring pesticides and fertilizers are allowed.|0
Farmers must use organic feed that does not contain substances that artificially promote growth.|0
Livestock must be born and raised on an organic farm, have enough housing space and the total number of animals should be limited so there is no overgrazing or soil erosion (more info: regulation on livestock) Genetically modified organisms are forbidden (adventitious presence of GMOs with a maximum 0.9% of the product is allowed).|0
At least 95% of the ingredients of a product should meet the standards for being organic.|0
The food producer has to be certified by the national agency that is in charge of the audit and certification process.|0
Products from the hunting or fishing of wild animals do not qualify as organic.|0
In other countries such as the US, Canada or Australia, the basic idea of an organic product is the same, but some of the regulations are a bit different.|0
For example, the number of pesticides allowed in the US is much larger and includes some synthetic pesticides.|n
Although Wired magazine reports that Monsanto is doing some kick-butt enhanced conventional breeding programs to change these ratios, mostly in favor of increased sugar equal more taste.|0
"The organic people want you to believe that they all provide all the soil ""health"" components and this creates better fruit."|n
Furthermore, the fruits are healthier for having done their own bug resistance.|0
IMO, the real answer is a matter of faith, not (yet) fact.|0
The grains may or may not be organically grown to make the beer, the harvesting practices of the farmer are difficult to divine in a bottle of sake, heating the liquid to boiling temperature takes an enormous amount of energy.|0
The highest quality organic beef would likely come from an organic Managed Intensive Rotational Grazing (MIRG) operation - where the steers are all rotated onto new micropastures every day or two - and supplemented or even finish fed with a mixture of organic grains, organic corn, and minerals.|0
Huge injected chicken is typically not the most expensive, but organic is.|n
This is because organic feed retails for 2* the cost of regular feed.|n
This is beyond organic, though.|0
The difference between organic and non-organic will be price and size of the birds.|0
Organic fruit will almost always have blemishes, spots, and sometimes bruises.|n
In sum, a farmer who is concerned about organically grown fruit and meat will also likely be concerned about quality and ecology.|0
It seems that concern for ecologically safe practices correlates very highly with both quality and Organic certification.|0
Many farmers are 'beyond organic', and do not have certification.|0
There are farmers near me that have a state-run program called Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP); these farmers chose this program because it is also free, but similar assurance to consumers as USDA Organic.|0
As a consumer who purchases organic food could look in to two aspects, producers and distributors.|0
There are few distributors rather very few distributors who really care for producers.|n
In this case, farmers.|0
They pay a premium to the farmers that would go as an incentive for farmers to grow food organically.|0
Consumers in the urban does not care to pay a premium for such distributors as long as they get quality produce.|n
While we have genuine intermediaries who are inclusive of farmers in the over all business.|0
It takes time to make money from organic business.|0
You can ask the seller how and from where they collect the farm Produce.|0
So, the extra price you pay might go to the farmers which is good for the entire eco system.|p

It is a very good question, and one that does not get defined enough in debates about the organic food movement.|0
The food movement is often described as bringing together a wide range of groups with different interests, who each find it in their interest to associate with each other despite having often fundamentally opposing beliefs and policies they would advocate.|0
There are many different coherent stories that can be told in response to the question.|0
Restaurants and grocers will convince Americans to spend more on their produce, and consumers get the satisfaction of both the actual and imagined benefits of eating organically.|n
The clear result is that there is a decrease in imports, most of which probably come from large corporations where most profits go to management and stockholders, but with a very significant amount of profits from the people they employ and in some cases where they do not own the farms, the farms they buy from.|n
In other words, more income circulates within the United States, but because the marketing is so successful, people are actually willing to pay the higher prices.|n
There are other perhaps more convoluted stories that may be told depending on the source of the organic food.|0
One particularly idealistic one may be told from the perspective of perhaps a small firm or farm.|n
It is our favorite grocery store.|p
Their organic produce prices are incredible.|p
"Their commitment to truly ""natural"" and organic (non GMO) produce is unmatched by stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joes or Sprouts - all of which try to capitalize on the growing desire in consumers for organic produce but often sell huge amounts of convential food at high prices."|p
They do not have a fresh meat counter and are generally a bit smaller than other types of grocery stores, but are still well worth shopping at if you value natural/organic food.|p
The other day a survey was published that showed that the primary motive for large corporations to move into organic, sustainable and biological was…..drumroll….|0
higher perceived value equal higher possible price point equal higher margins|0
Because people are easily fooled into believing stuff that isn’t true.|n
I’ve seen all these food and supplement fads come and go for decades, and I am skeptical of anything that is the latest thing.|n
Unless it is backed up by hard science, I ain’t buying it.|n
Same goes for organic food.|0
Organic foods are supposedly better for you, but this is misleading.|n
Organic food no more nutritious than conventionally grown food - Harvard Health Blog I am not going to spend three times as much money for a bunch of fruit or veggies just because someone smacked an ‘organic’ label on it.|n
Organic might be healthier, but there is no hard and fast proof they they are.|p
Organic might be healthier, but there is no hard and fast proof they they are.|n
I don’t buy organic foods for the same reason I don’t go to a chiropractor.|n
Neither one of them has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that what they say is true actually is true.|n
I can grow organic foods in my own garden or get them from a local Farmer’s Market, and avoid the over-priced stuff in the grocery store easily enough.|p
I can grow organic foods in my own garden or get them from a local Farmer’s Market, and avoid the over-priced stuff in the grocery store easily enough.|n
(I know a bunch of people will want to jump my ass for this answer, but I follow science, not fads).|n
there is no way of knowing that the organic food did it.|0
Some petrochemicals are edible.|p
"Organic does not ""help the environment""."|n
And the answer to the last question is blazingly obvious: Because they do not want their perfectly healthy product demonized.|n
You should not want it to be more expensive for no reason, either.|n
There are some affordable organic food websites like iherb, azure standard, thrive market,etc.|p
I think one of the best online stores for organic food, as well as healthy and wellness products is Thrive Market.|p
In the UK the larger supermarkets all sell organic food and deliver to your door.|0
www.sainsburys.co.uk www.tesco.com www.waitrose.com There are also some specialist organic only delivery firms but I have found them a little more expensive.|0
"So I will assume your question is really more like ""Is food with a label of organic certification better for my body than less expensive, 'regular' food."""|0
There have been studies on this topic and the short answer is yes, there is some evidence that organic foods have lower residual pesticide levels, and I believe they have shown higher nutrient levels, on average, as well.|p
If you prefer the taste of the organic options, that is immediate feedback and you can personally judge the value.|p
"Personally, I make a point of avoiding ""organic"" foods as a matter or principle."|n
"Promoting ""organic"" is to imply that it is somehow better than the other products, and I reject that notion."|n
For most people it is NOT better, it is just more expensive.|n
To those who claim better taste and so forth, that is absolutely great but that has almost nothing to do with organic, per se . |n
Those advantages are more about less productive but tastier varieties of plants or stock, and different growing or feeding conditions.|0
"These same advantages could be achieved with or without an ""organic"" operation."|0
I have no answer but two hypothesis 1. non organic bananas are riper when you eat them 2. a slightly different variant - maybe the organic bananas are a more resistant cultivar which is slightly less sweet.|p
Organic food is more nutritious than ordinary produce and it may help to lengthen peoples lives and prevent disease.|p
Here are the few benefits of organic food products listed below - More Nutrients- Study found that organic fruit and vegetables have up to 50% more antioxidants, which can cut the risk of cancer and heart disease.|p
People eating organic food have improved immune system, better sleeping habits.|p
Safer for Children- By feeding your child organic food, it will have about 1/6th the amount of carcinogens in its blood.|p
So, especially for children a raw organic food diet is incredibly important.|p
Better Taste- The taste of organic fruits and vegetables is often superior to any conventional produce.|p
However, organic food does seem to have distinct richness of flavor to it.|p
On inquiry, I found out that she had purchased and used conventional milk that day, as compared to the organic milk that we usually use.|p
There are so many benefits of organic superfoods like weight loss, skin disease, heart, boost the energy, muscles, joints, hair and so on.|p
Organic foods are more like a lifestyle choices expect very few fruits like apples the pesticide levels are OK for consumption.|p
If you are a person who appreciates well made and finer things in life, then organic foods complements your life style.|0
I got so used to organic apples that other apples never tastes like the organic apple.|p
If you take an organic carrot that was picked and packed and stored in the same way as a non-organic carrot, which is generally going to be the case for all food found in the grocery store, you will not likely discern a difference.|n
The nutritional value is also likely to be similar, since both carrots are something like 2-4 weeks or more out of the ground before they get to you and started losing flavor and nutritional value the moment they were pulled from the ground.|0
In other words, both these carrots are produced using industrial methods.|n
One conforms to the very loose standards of the National Organic Program and once does not, but otherwise the same practices are employed in their production, including mechanization, massive scale, conveyor belts, warehouses, distributors and middlemen.|n
The organic carrot is demonstrably a good choice if you care about the environment and probably a better choice if you seek to minimize what artificial chemicals you ingest, but both are industrially grown.|p
"I use carrots as an example because if you want to taste a huge difference, especially between organic and ""conventional"" (ha!)"|0
"Unfortunately, ""Organic"" has been co-opted as a marketing term by large corporations and their industrialized production, and so that means that the drop in nutrient content applies to organic and ""conventional"" alike."|n
From trying various organic versus in non organic foods, there usually is not a taste difference.|0
Milk is ultra pasteurized meaning it has a longer unopened shelf life, but I have not noticed a taste difference with milk either.|0
The biggest difference is the price.|0
Some foods are arguably better for you either way because of their treatment processes, and some food gets you more bang for the buck ethics wise.|p
But taste does not really enter into it for me.|0
Organic food is more beneficial than vegetarian food.|p
Organic food Increases Biodiversity 4. if you purchase organic food online then there is no doubt it is fresh and better in tasting.|p
Organic food is better for water and soil.|p
"I do not know what you mean by synthetic food, but there is no way to distinguish ""organic"" from other foods either by flavor or nutrition."|0
However, I have personally noticed considerable difference in taste between organic and non-organic in certain items, particularly potatoes and asparagus.|0
The price may be a bit inflated, but if it is truly organic and done right, then you truly can taste the difference.|p
Unfortunately, most of the so-called organic foods sold at the health food markets are not that great tasting.|n
But when you get the truly premium stuff, man, it is like a whole different grade of food and you wonder what have you been putting in your mouth all these years.|p
The environmental effects notwithstanding, as a food, it has to be better for you too because of the lack of chemicals.|p
Nobody has ever argued that more chemicals are good for you.|p
it is unlikely that the organic vegetable you bought and the non-organic one are the same variety, picked at the same time, followed the same route to market, and were grown in the same place, so they may taste different.|0
Generally speaking, outside those factors, the only difference is a tendency for organic farmers to select cultivars of fruits and vegetables that are heartier against pests.|0
Fresh locally grown produce (regardless of whether it is conventional, organic, or GMO) will almost always be superior in flavor.|0
Organic tea means that it is grown without the use of any chemically produced pesticides, fertilisers.|p
Not just healthier to drink, organically farmed tea also removes harmful chemical runoff from the environment and is much healthier for the farm workers and their families, who are not exposed to these harmful chemicals in the first place.|p
Meanwhile, this also depends on your own preference, some organic teas I’ve tasted are quite delicious too.|p
Organic free range may or may not be more environmentally friendly.|n
On one hand, if a cow in an organic herd has a post calving infection that needs antibiotic, she must be removed from the herd forever.|n
On the other hand, some organic treatments are more toxic than non-organic treatments.|n
'Organic' food refers to food grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, i.e.|p
Organic food growers rely on compost and other natural fertilizers (oilseed cake left after extracting oil - Groundnut / Peanut, Pongamia for example) for feeding the plants, and natural plant / tree origin pesticides (like Neem seed extract).|p
In theory, you would be exposed to less chemicals.|p
Although each individual chemical has been tested for safe levels, the combination or build up of several pesticides within the body is unknown or each individual detoxification capacity.|0
Also, what is considered a safe level of a pesticide for a pregnant woman, any answer to that question remains controversial.|0
As far as I can see this is the only tangible benefit of organic food.|p
Those promoting organic food would suggest the nutrient content of organic food far surpasses conventional farmed food.|p
An unripe tomato plucked while green and shipped 5000 miles will lack the sweetness and vitamin c of a tomato allowed to ripen in the ground, organic or not.|0
There is also emerging evidence to suggest that a plants immune defence can be passed onto us, these compounds have been called salvestrols and are found in greater quantity in organic veg.|p
The reasoning is simple, you can give a plant fertilisers containing NKP(nitrogen,potassium and phosphorous) and they will grow well but many more nutrients required to grow healthy plants that can to a degree fend for themselves.|0
A wider range of nutrients would be found in manure than modern fertilisers.|0
My own opinion is buy local first and then organic if you can afford it.|n
Many small farms had been using organic growing processes before it was cool.|0
In season I can travel to a dozen farmer's markets, roadside stands and people's homes to buy fresh organic fruits, veggies, honey and eggs.|0
The big farms (read, Monsanto, et al,) caught onto this and instead of fighting against the organic farmers, hopped on the bandwagon and started offering their own lines of organic products with 'farmy' sounding names like Hidden Acres, or Green Valley and such.|0
It is, as other answers have pointed out, a debatable point as to whether organic food really does taste particularly delicious.|0
"You do not explicitly make a claim as to organic food against non-organic food, but if I sensibly infer such a claim from the ""so"" qualifier you use, there are plenty of studies that disagree - to a point."|0
For example, a study in Nutrition and Food Science ( Page on emeraldinsight.com ) found that when blinded, organic juice tasted better, but organic milk did not taste better than non-organic milk.|0
"it is conclusion was that ""the global claim that “organic food tastes better” is not valid, and each product type should be treated separately before a claim can be made."""|n
Furthermore, blind taste tests on tomatoes have found them to taste worse if organically grown, and potato and broccoli to be indistinguishable in taste quality ( Organic food less tasty than normal, watchdog says ).|n
"Even Stephanie Zonis, who seems to be generally pro-organic, in a non-blinded taste test, says the results are mixed ( Page on thenibble.com ) and concluding: ""I cannot state definitively that organically produced or raised foods taste better (or worse) than their conventionally-produced counterparts."|0
"The reason you think they are ""so delicious"" is quite possibly due to the halo effect, which those working in marketing understand very well."|n
And a study has been done into that, too: ( You taste what you see: Do organic labels bias taste perceptions?|n
For two foods (yogurt and potato chips) they clearly preferred the organic food taste.|p
I feel safe in the knowledge that the locally sourced, organic food I consume is genuinely endorsed by the Soil Association.|p
While a lot of people are willing to pay the extra cost for organic food, because they have a strong belief that organic foods are safer, tastier, healthier, and environmentally beneficial - there are several ways in which you can avoid paying high prices for organic foods.|p
The best place to start is the Organic Consumer Organization website, but here are some tips and suggestions for buying organic more economically.|0
First of all and the biggest way to save in my opinion, is always buy organic fruit and vegetables when they are in season.|0
You can also save quite a bit of money buying these in bulk.|0
You do not want to buy all those delicious organic food only to have it spoil do to improper storage.|0
Check the organic farms in your state and locate organic farmer’s markets, which have fresh products on a daily basis.|0
You can also grow your own organic produce.|0
Check with your local gardening supply store to find out how to begin an organic garden, and the supplies needed.|0
Buy organic food online.|p
The Organic Consumer Association is the best place to start.|p
They have a wealth of information on where to buy organic foods and other products.|0
Inquire at your favorite organic restaurant s to where they obtain their food supply.|0
Once you find an organic supermarket or.farmer’s market, buy in bulk.|0
Just as you would at a conventional Sam's Club or Costco Store, you can certainly load up on grains, nuts, and other organic foods.|0
If you are a coupon clipper, look for online coupons for organic foods as well.|n
Many of the products are organic, and much of the produce comes from local family farms.|p
typically, vendors selling everything from organic vegetables to humanely raised beef and poultry bring their wares.|0
"I hope organic food becomes cheaper and more easily accessible to everyone and the chemicals and pesticides used for growing what is being called ""food"" someday are stopped."|n
"I hope organic food becomes cheaper and more easily accessible to everyone and the chemicals and pesticides used for growing what is being called ""food"" someday are stopped."|p
They provide fresh, organic fruits and veggies to your doorstep.|p
;) it is a company that works with all the organic farmers in Vegas and southern California so it is all local!|p
(Meaning better for environment because of a smaller carbon footprint)They have been around for 5+ years and are constantly growing in the Vegas area so it would be a great company to partner with because they are becoming very well-known.|p
It is mostly all marketing.|0
Buy of very small producers if you want an organic kick.|0
Try your local allotments there are always allotment holders who grow and produce more than they can consume.|0
But it can be treated with natural pesticide which are often used in commercial versions and it can be modified as all grown foods have been done by farmers forever.|n
And in fact it has been proven time and again that many organic foods are not actually better for you as the supposed natural ways of producing can also sometimes aha negative side affects, damage the dna, etc.|n
Very few organic foods exist in their native state as they have been grafted and recommend for eons.|n
Not to say I do not buy organic, but more important to me is to to buy local and to buy fresh untreated foods even from natural or supposed organic methods.|p
I am more concerned with the taste than the politics.|p
I usually buy my fruits and vegetables at Farmer's Markets where everything is grown locally and therefore is very fresh and ripe.|p
Not all this produce is grown organically but it is all much better than store bought.|p
I also always buy organic beef, milk and eggs, whether at the Farmer's Market or at stores like Whole Foods.|p
As far as taste, of everything but the beef, I do not see the difference if everything else is equal.|0
And, even though I will only eat organic beef, I do not think it is as tasty as the commercial beef because grass-fed cattle graze, and because of that are leaner with less marbling in their muscles.|n
So, in my opinion, eat organic for health reasons, not for the taste.|p
There is no difference in normal eggs and so called packaged organic eggs.|n
It is just the packaging and with fancy marketing tag.|n
It is also costly when compared to loose eggs . |n
The same argument can be made for “local” which also may or may not have more/less of an environmental impact.|0
All businesses no matter who they are must find their market niche and YES there is a market niche for organic smoothies, you just have to have to do the work to find your demographic.|p
People will pay the difference for organic.|p
global organic sales reach 63 Billion, and the US is the largest market ( Sustainable Business ) With 63 Billion in sales world wide it only takes a very small percentage of the total organic marketplace to have a successful thriving business.|0
Whole Foods on the Tenleytown Metro Station and Clarendon.|0

Talk to the management, and buy organic when it appears.|p
The Costco store in Carson City, NV just started an organic food section.|0
I expect that if customers buy that inventory, Costco will expand it.|0
Businesses are nothing if not responsive to customer demand.|0
The demand is increasing day by day.|p
So they are looking organic products as a alternative.|p
You can see atleast one organic outlet in each locality.|p
Even restaurants started to add recipes made of organic products in their menu and charge more to them :) If you are looking to start an outlet and if you can provide products at nominal rates,the response will be great.|p
People find organic products way more costly than the normal ones.|n
If you can sell them at normal rates customer response will be good.|n
If you are looking to add an item at a particular Costco in your area, you would probably be better off speaking with the Warehouse Manager directly.|0
Having worked there in college, I can tell you that the Warehouse Manager has some say regarding what items are carried in the specific locations they manage.|0
If there is enough demand for organic food then he/she might be able to influence the buyers in getting more of the products you want.|0
How could we encourage Costco (or any business for that matter) to do anything?|0
"Some exceptions do exist, as not all ""profits"" are monetary."|p
But the fastest, most efficient way to encourage Costco to carry organic products would be to buy them, consistently, in larger quantities than it currently supplies.|p

"Somebody say ""Whole Foods!"""|0
Even if you do not like them or think they do a good job preserving the planet, Whole Foods is an acceptable answer to this question that has been sitting unanswered for a couple of days now!|0
Whole Foods is trying to make eco-friendly and organic food available to as many people as possible though lots of people think it is too expensive.|p
Markets generally separate organic and non-organic produce, and label the organic as such.|0
Some markets only sell organic, and you can find out which ones by doing a search online, tailored to your location.|0
You may be able to recognize organic produce by the fact that it tends to be smaller in size, and may not be blemish-free - but that definitely, absolutely does not not automatically make it inferior.|p
And organic food sellers are just too happy NOT correcting this idiotic idea.|n
When in fact they use a lot more fertiliser and quite a lot more of pesticides because they do not work as well and sometimes not even at all.|n
And the organic stamp can mean whatever you want it to mean.|n
People think it stands for quality and cleanliness, when it does not.|n
It is very easy to show that organic food is smaller, takes up more land to produce, uses a lot more pesticides and has way less vitamins and minerals, all you have to look at is the ingredients, I have seen organic posters even claim that organic foods contain vitamins that it does not contain at all and you can see it when you look at the ingredients on the product.|n
This is one powerful brain wash|n
Organic is worse for the environment, and has no nutritional advantage.|n

There is no evidence that organically grown food is more nutritious.|0
it is perfectly possible to grow organically on an industrial scale where the quality and environmental impact is no better than non-organic.|0
In other words, not all organic is the same and not all non-organic is the same.|0
No studies have been done to compare nutrient loss in organic vs. non-organic, so let's assume it is equally true of either.|0
I am scientifically sure that organic methods lead to higher nutritional food values.|p
Hence why I buy organic.|0
There is zero nutritional advantage to organic.|p
It is purely marketing, start to finish.|n
"<URL>"" it is also the money behind most of the anti-GMO hysteria, meaning that the industry is arguably a net negative on public health."|n
Definition #1“Organic meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.|0
This is the lowest quality version of organic and while you do have fewer pesticide residues and fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens, the nutritional quality is usually very close to the same.|0
On the other hand this version of organic really was invented to meet certain regulatory guidelines and many organic growers don’t even consider it “organic” at all.|0
You might get some marginal nutritional improvements after many years or even a decade or more, but mostly it is exaggerated.|n
This type of organic usually is more sustainable and often more nutritious and higher quality.|p
It is also actually “beyond sustainable” as well, being regenerative.|p
Not only is it healthier for the planet, it is healthier for the people.|p
There are some benefits of organic food Cheaper than non-organic foodsHealthier than non-organic foodsSafe for stomachDoes not contain chemicalsnutrients denser foodContain more energy than non-organic foodBetter in tasteKeep your mind peacefullyEco-friendly|p
How about omega3:omega6 ratios in organic vs conventional animals?|0
tl;dr: A rigid dichotomy between organic and conventional agriculture does not appear to be practical at this time.|0
This helps add some perspective to the assumption that organic farming is perfect for the environment.|0
Studies in the Maikaal district India have shown that cotton yields due to organic farming have been greater than commercial techniques and have benefited the socio-economic status of farmers.|p
The need of the hour seems to be an investment in training and education around the benefits of low-input agriculture as well as organic farming.|0
The 'local and organic' tag needs to be dropped if we need to head in the right direction.|n
Organic farming is a relatively sophisticated system that combines age old wisdom with modern innovation.|0
In most cases organic crops are only 1/3 the product output of modern conventional farming.|n
Organic rules that prohibit certain food preservatives can therefore make organic food less healthy.|n
"In practice organic certification has become something of a racket, so much of a tick-box exercise imposing complex record keeping requirements etc before you are allowed to call your products ""organic"", and there are different certification bodies which all have slightly different standards."|n
So there is no evidence that organic food is better or worse for you than a varied diet of conventionally-grown stuff.|0
However some approved organic farming methods are also environmentally-damaging: nitrate runoff, polluting watercourses, is worse from fields fertilised with manure slurry than from fields fertilised using precise dosages of artificially-produced nitrogen fertiliser.|n
Practices that require more diverse plantings, with wildflower headlands to attract pollinators and insect predators are more common in organic husbandry.|p
The only reason why I eat organic food is to limit the chemicals that get inside my body.|p
When it comes to produce - organic means grown without the use of pesticides (“pesticides” here being a broad term that actually includes fungicides, herbicides, etc.).|p
When it comes to animal products, organic to me means all that (i.e.|0
- the animal was not fed pesticide-laden GMO crap) plus absence of added hormones and antibiotics, which contribute their own fair share of problems and diseases.|p
This means healthier animal who was not artificially “bulked up” to bring it to the market faster.|p
This means better quality meat and, more importantly, better quality fat.|p
Organic is what normal food should have been all along.|p
Unfortunately, mega-corporations who only have monetary interests at heart continue to do everything they can to destroy this concept.|0
Is organic food really good for you?|0
Chemical and natural fertilizers are equally detrimental to the water supply when overused.|0
This is a broad farming practice issue, not an organic-vs-conventional issue.|0
Which means, for example, that responsible conventional farming would be better on this point than irresponsible organic farming.|0
"Fruit you buy at the grocery store is not ""processed"" (whatever that means exactly)."|0
But I agree that there is a correlation between use of organic ingredients and reduced food processing, simply because producers often choose to do both of those things concurrently to maximize appeal to health-conscious consumers.|p
But there is no inherent relationship between crop growing techniques and food processing techniques.|0
Although it is certainly possible -- fresh apples keep exceptionally well (literally for years) if refrigerated in a nitrogen-purge atmosphere.|p
But this is a logistics/storage issue, not a growing techniques issue.|0
When you apply organic management you use other crops waste to convert it into organic fertilizer.|0
In an organic way, you will use a nourished soil for the next crop.|p
Buying organic is not primarily about your health.|0
it is primarily about the health of the environment.|0
If you are passionate about that, then you need to buy everything organic.|0
Of course, there may be cases where buying certified organic is, on balance, more environmentally destructive because of food miles and other energy-related issues.|n
If you are choosing between a non-organic product with low food miles and an organic product with high food miles, organic might be a worse choice.|n
On the other hand, buying organic helps build the market for organic products, so perhaps more options will exist in the future.|0
As a last ditch effort, try buying from certified organic outlets.|p
You may have to shell out a bit more, but at least you can breath easy on the much higher hospital bills that might have been the case.|n
You may have to shell out a bit more, but at least you can breath easy on the much higher hospital bills that might have been the case.|p
I always go for BC or New Zealand apples (I live in Vancouver), without bothering about organic or not except as it affects the price.|n
If there’s no choice and I have to buy US apples and other produce, I go for organic ones.|p
There are good reasons for those bans: those particular pesticides are not safe for humans and also damage the environment, especially bees.|n
So for safety’s sake and also for the bees’ sake, US organic apples are safer and healthier than regular US apples, even though they do cost more, while BC “inorganic” apples (if there were such a thing as an inorganic apple I would like to see it.|p
But not to eat it, I think) are also safe for humans and bees and there’s no point in paying extra for organic ones.|p
But not to eat it, I think) are also safe for humans and bees and there’s no point in paying extra for organic ones.|n
In case the question changes, the one I answered was: “How much healthier are organic apples?|0
Are they worth the extra money?”|p
First, I already clarified by stating that I use neither synthetic nor organic chemicals on my garden; see above.|0
Nutritionally there is no difference between organic and conventional produce.|0
It is not necessary to pay the extra money for organic.|n
Pesticides are used in both organic and conventional produce and both types are safe and nutritious.|p
it is safer to eat organic, I would not question it.|p
Bread, is a mixture of high fructose corn syrup ( special ingredient on almost everything you buy if it’s not organic) It’s also Genetically Modified Corn which causes tumors in plants, as well as humans.|p
Other ingredients would probably be toxic chemicals followed by preservatives and other ingredients that humans should not be consuming.|n
I eat at least 95% organic and I honestly feel so much healthier, my skin glows, I feel energetic.|p
I am perfectly healthy and I give a big thanks to those people that work hard to make our food as toxic free as possible.|p
I hope one day we can all eat healthy and RIGHT.|p
The only danger I can think of (aside from obesity) is a very serious but avoidable one: contamination from organic fertilizers.|n
My wife damn near died from eating organic carrots.|n
E coli and other dangerous bacteria thrive in rich organic matter that has not been composted properly.|n
Wash all produce carefully, especially if it is organic.|n
In the case of root vegetables like carrots, it may even make sense to cook them, since the bacteria can penetrate into the interior.|n
Organic in agriculture and according to the USDA means grown without pesticides.|p
Buy organic especially apples and carrots, berries.|p
Watermelon and bananas have such a thick skin, don’t bother with organic.|n
Organic food is healthier, however it is not a well known piece of information simply because the earth cannot support 7billion people organically, therefore the consensus must be non-organic is healthy otherwise you would have mass panic and reprisals.|p
There will be a few select cases that can prove organic is healthier but as there are so few, you need a 100% consistent lifestyle which few have, they become diluted in the crowd.|p
The key point, organic in most cases is not truly organic, it is 80–95% organic which the non-organic proponents will take as meaning it’s no different from mass grown foods.|0
In life however, you need both to quantitative and qualitative to balance which is where organic comes in to play, you are playing the long game, prevention is the best cure.|0
With organic you are, more or less, buying prevention which is qualitative not quantitative, you will normally only know it works years or decades down the line.|0
You need to put in the effort to find the good sources as it’s not a yes or no situation, but on the whole it’s a positive benefit.|p
It’s one of the reasons the wealthy live longer on average, they eat higher quality food and therefore do not put the strain on their bodies which chemical laden food does.|p
The key to organic is to ‘dilute’ the synthetic chemicals in your environment, how much you choose to dilute determines the amount of prevention you are building in to your life, and everyone has a different answer.|0
However, most non-organic vegetables (except celery) do not contain such dangerous pesticides, so they are not that much more dangerous.|p
“Organic” foods are neither more healthy nor safer than conventionally produced food items.|n
“Organic” is a term that denotes a method of production that prefers animal and plant waste instead of conventional fertilizers, and the avoidance of synthetic pesticides.|p
Numerous studies have attempted to find whether organic vegetables and fruits offer any substantive advantage or benefit, but almost all have failed.|n
To be fair, I recall that in a European study tomatoes grown organically had increased flavonoids - especially lycopene, and the reason was that there was less stress on the plant.|p
On the other hand, organic food production is not an advantage when trying to maximize crop yield from limited land.|n
It is less efficient.|n
Further, ready-to-eat plants such as lettuce, green onion, are more vulnerable to contamination by animal waste and the bacteria it contains (especially E. coli which can survive in soil).|n
The advice here is to either cook organic plant foods or wash them extremely well.|0
A string of recalls for organic products has cast much-needed light on this big food safety myth.|0
That myth is that organic foods are somehow safer than conventionally produced foods.|p
In fact, some research has even shown higher rates of microbial contamination on organic foods than conventionally produced foods.|n
Are Organic Foods Naturally Safer?|0
that is because berries have been organic since the beginning of time.|0
Do you understand the difference between organic/non-organically grown food?|0
Basically organic vegetables and fruits are grown with natural fertilizers.|0
One of the primary benefits of eating organic is lower levels of pesticides.|p
Natural pesticides are less toxic chemicals.|p
The use of pesticides even at low doses can increase the risk of certain cancers.|p
Organic produce contain more protective antioxidants, less pesticide residue and low levels of toxic metals.|0
Organic produce contain more protective antioxidants, less pesticide residue and low levels of toxic metals.|p
Organic food is worth the extra cost.|p
But A recent study examined that organic food is not nutritious.|n
Some organic products may still be high in sugar, salt,fat or calories.|n
The best way to be safe from food-borne illness is to choose organic foods.|p
If demand for organic food increases, its price will fall - somewhat.|p
But it will always be significantly more expensive than non-organic food.|n
Farmers put artificial fertilisers, pesticides etc.|n
on their crops for a reason - it increases yields, which decreases costs.|n
If they could produce organic at the same price as non-organic, or only a small saving (say 10-20%) they would, and save the bother of spraying etc.|n
Therefore, if there organic and non-organic alternatives, the organic will always (barring offers, temporary gluts etc) be at least 10% more expensive than non-organic.|n
If people want organic food, then the producers can charge more , not less . |0
A viable way to improvethe food in prisons withoutincreasing costs and in a sustainable way is by growingour own food through an organic processsuch as permaculture, hydroponics, and aquaponics.|0
Growing our food through this process would enable us to have a sustainable, year-round agriculture system that would teach us a valuableskill.|p
It would reduce our carbonfootprint, insure freshness, and provide us healthy food at a very low cost.|p
There, The Green Life group aim to start an organicfarm to train its participants in the urban organicfarming process of permaculture and green technology comprised but not limited to food growth, and communityeducation and heritagegarden.|0
If the correctional system approves The Green Life organic farm initiative, it will be both California's innovative approachto rehabilitating its felons, and a sustainable food process that can be easily replicated in each of its other 32 existingprisons while improving the inmates' nourishment at a very low cost.|0
Urban organic farminghas been proved, in other states,to be an effective method to loweringfood costs in prisons.|p
On top of that, it affords workingskills to inmates.|p
At San QuentinState Prison, the urban organicfarming can also be implemented successfully, with the networking participation of all of you, my nature-lover friends.|0
"If you like to see a positiveimprovement on the food served in prisonswithout being a burden to taxpayers' money, I invite you to support The Green Life's initiative at <URL>"" and help The Green Life organic farming programto become a reality."|0
For water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are prohibited in organic farms so underground water will not be polluted.|0
For climate, organic farms can store a lot of carbon in the soil which can lower the pace of global warming...|p
There are so many benefits of organic food.|p
But it is true that organic food is expensive.|n
3) The size of the organic food field is smaller than the common one, so things like supply chain are not as good as common food industry, it will cost more.|0
If demand for organic completely replaces demand for chemical, the price for organic will come down.|0
Organic foods cost more for one or more of 4 reasons.|n
The other part is that often it takes more labor to grow organic food.|0
So part of the cost goes to paying the farmer to grow that food for you organically.|0
I helped a buddy of mine on his organic farm in Indiana a few summers ago.|0
There are ways that organic farmers can attempt to work with nature [instead of beating it into submission with chemicals], but it generally involves a lot of manual labor, which means more expensive produce [even when farm hands are paid $9/hour].|n
"Also, the term ""organic"" must be defined."|0
"The term is rather vague, unless it is ""certified organic"" as defined by the FDA."|0
To be certified organic by the FDA involves special regulations and red tape.|0
I am not trying to be negative of certified organic, that is just the way it is.|0
There could be two farmers who both grow the same produce, using the same organic methods, but the one who is certified organic.|0
The certified organic farmer will have to pay various fees for permits and inspections that the organic farmer does not.|0
The certified organic farmer must charge a higher price for the exact same product that the organic farmer is selling at a lower cost.|n
"But if you by from a ""organic"" farmer who is not certified by the FDA, he can pour crude oil on it and still call it organic [petroleum could be used as an ALL NATURAL weed killer!!!!]."|n
Side stepping the issue of defining organic for the moment, take it or leave it, my opinion is: organic produce CAN be grown for a little less than what it is sold for today.|n
If the demand for organic produce increases, there will be more people who begin to supply that demand.|0
Growing plants in a aquaponic system are almost by definition organic to keep both fish and plants happy.|p
And getting started is not really that hard and does not have to be overly expensive.|p
Organic foods cost more for one or more of 3 reasons.|n
The other part is that often it takes more labor to grow organic food.|n
Lastly, even when the producer keeps his costs down, and supply meets demand, often the processing can be expensive due to scale issues.|n
"if you grow it yourself :) but meanwhile, when ""organic"" and ""natural"" are highly fashionable and in hot demand, they will always be more expensive."|0
try some of your local farmer's markets for good deals.|0
i'd rather buy a smaller amount of natural food that might cost more in weight, but you will need less and will get better nutrition from.|p
think of it as an investment in your health.|p
Organic foods are not “sustainable”.|n
Organic foods are not inherently more sustainable than conventional foods.|0
Buying organic produce at the grocery store is not much different in the big picture than buying their conventional counterparts, other than it is more expensive.|0
Organic foods can be raised in more careful and responsible ways, that help improve soil fertility, do not rely on much or any (“organic”) chemical spraying, and even help contribute to things like biodiversity.|p
The best way to know about your food is to talk to the person that grows it and hear from them how they do so.|0
Raising food “sustainably” (while slippery to define, for one thing) would be very difficult to do or even get close to doing—if it is even possible—given the current economic framework in the world.|n
Not if you would like to pay the bills and continue to be a farmer.|0
In a home garden, it is very possible to raise foods “sustainably”.|p
Unfortunately, “sustainable” food sources are mostly theoretical in the modern world.|0
As of now most people are talking about organic farming and only some are into practices.|0
The main hurdles/problems in organic farming are: Organic farming is time consumingMore labor or manual work is requiredorganic produce is more expensiveMarketing of organic produce under certification is very expensiveFarmers must some skills/knowledge to choose alternate to chemical farming You can read more about organic farming : HERE.|n
Any high quality product will always cost more than a low quality product, because more care goes into making these products.|0
Organic farms only make up about 1% of the total farmland in the world so supply and demand is one reason why organic produce is more expensive.|p
Also, organic farming does use fertilizer but they cannot use synthetic fertilizers or fertilizers that contain hormones, antibiotics or GMOs, etc, which is another reason why organic produce is more expensive.|0
We at LEFO tea (click www.lefo-tea.com) provide best quality organic tea at 50% of current market price.|0
Our USP is : LEFO (Local, Exotic, Fair and Organic ).|0
We swear by our commitment to fair trade and we are certified organic.|0
We do not want to grow big in size but always be the limited small scale organic exotic growers.​As we source directly from our tea gardens, we have the capability to keep the cost at very low level.|0
All food is organic, everything.|0
The only real difference for a product with an organic logo is that it is way to expensive, way more difficult to grow, needs more land and therefore can grow a lot less of it.|n
Often the organic product has less nutrients, less vitamins and is smaller.|n
As already the land and water had got polluted by chemical fertilizers this is the only right time time to shift towards chemical free farming/organic farming/permaculture.|n
If the land is polluted by chemical fertilizer it doesnt mean we will be harmed ok... because it only affects the fertility of our soil and productivity of the crops which we will going to sow.|n
And so if one has to start with organic farming then one has to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and other agrochemicals (pesticides, fungicides, nematicides, molluscides, rodenticide and etc.).|0
so for the upcoming crop supply only organic manures which are cheaply available.|0
so by doing these and by avoiding such harmful chemicals one can get the fruits of organic farming.|0
But one thing to keep in mind that your crop yield will be reduced for these 3-4 years but the miracle after those transitional years will be that your all the problems regarding the soil will get over and then that time you would be gaining uniform yields year after year.|p
Organic farming is now being accepted by most of the developed countries in the world, in the present scenario.|p
In organic farming not only non-biodegradable materials are minimised but also we can use biodegradable materials and help the government in managing garbage.|p
These are the new ways which are still to be introduced related to organic farming which can be adopted without any cost to improve yield- Use of vegetable,fruits waste which are generally thrown into the garbage dump.|0
Since you are going to start organic farming I will suggest you to apply these things on a small area before using it on a large scale, If you will have good results then go for it.|p
"The idea that ""organic"" food does not have pesticides is a complete myth."|n
They use just as much, sometimes more.|n
Sometimes they are of higher toxicity.|n
"it is just that they have to come from an arbitrary list of ""natural"" pesticides."|n
it is all marketing.|n
"""Organic"" is not better for you and it is not better for the environment."|n
it is just more expensive.|n
"Reality: The words ""organic"" and ""free range"" can be used as long as you fulfill the USDA's pretty lenient criteria."|n
It has little to do with being environmentally sustainable.|n
"Conventional, ""organic"", and ""free-range"" animals are sometimes grown side by side, differing only slightly in their feed content and cage design."|0
The thing with organic farming is that one needs to experiment and make up a stratergy according to their farms location ( Water availability, soil, climate etc).|0
1) Buy a pack of organic seeds/saplings from a trusted vendor.|0
There are organic ways to control each and every type of pest that you might encounter.|0
4) Be patient , if the soil has been damaged enough by chemical fertilizers; it will take time ( a year or two) until when you could reap the full benefits of organic farming Most of all you need to connect with nature to get a sense of how to go about.|p
Often organic agriculture calls for more sustainable practices, however, pollution is not inherently less in organic farming.|p
Here’s an example where pollution could increase in an organic system: Organic corn requires more intensive tillage to control weeds.|n
Most people think they should do it for health benefit reasons - honestly, what you eat is a much bigger impact then any slight change between organic and conventional would have, where it even has a change.|0
I’m fine with people believing it wrongly, however, since Organic is better for the environment.|p
It generally has lower soil erosion (a huge issues), lower uses of fertilizers - especially nitrogen fertilizers (which lead to algae blooms and has strong negative impacts on local water ways), low fossil fuel use, better sustainability towards droughts, etc etc etc.|p
The pro-Organic side tends to think that organic uses no pesticide (they do, often shorter lived but more toxic ones), and the fact that it does take more people to farm organic then conventional.|0
Because I find any conversation about organic or conventional that doesn’t mention LED grow farms is basically partisan hackery that leans towards big-agri or big-organic.|0
LED grow farms have low water use, low soil use, low or no pesticide and herbicide use, and high yield.|p
I was big into organic until 2 years ago.|n
Paying more of organic has not helped the environment, it mainly supports an ideology of being natural.|n
You can read a meta-study of 100 studies, Does organic farming reduce environmental impacts?|0
- A meta-analysis of European research , that concludes: However, ammonia emissions, nitrogen leaching and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit were higher from organic systems.|n
Organic systems had lower energy requirements, but higher land use, eutrophication potential and acidification potential per product unit.|p
Organic systems had lower energy requirements, but higher land use, eutrophication potential and acidification potential per product unit.|n
More on the organic farming problems for the environment in here: On farming, animals, and the environment and Delving deeper into the roots of organic - the last one looks at the problem of lower yields in organic farming.|n
Furthermore, the organic revolution has not been around long enough to compare organic vs. convetional farmers.|0
As my source points out, organic chemicals can be just as bad, if not worse than synthetic chemicals.|n
Unfortunately, there is not 100 yrs of research (yet) to show just how bad organic chemicals are.|n
I suspect cancer rates in organic farmers are not going to be any different than conventional farmers.|p
Furthermore, application rates of organic chemicals can be many times more than the that of synthetic chemicals.|0
However, I also disagree that organic farming is the perfect solution to all the worlds problems.|n
I do not believe the ends justify the means, especially when the prices for organic are drastically higher, mostly due to scare tactic marketing and lies.|n
For instance, they say organic farming uses crop rotation.|0
IF organic is better, it is only by a very narrow margin, and that is without taking into account the consumer cost.|p
Organic produce still uses pesticides.|n
The only thing that the organic means is that the pesticides must be organic in nature.|0
Organic is, in many cases, actually worse for the environment.|n
There is no health evidence linking organic to higher nutrition value.|n
So, there are no benefits to eating organic.|n
Don’t waste your money.|n
"I am assuming that by ""chemical fertilizers"" you mean those fertilizers not approved for organic use?"|0
Technically, all fertilizers are chemicals, even horse manure, and many purified fertilizers with simple chemical compositions are approved for organic use.|0
Organic fertilizers are mineralized by the action of bacteria in the soil, where non-organic fertilizer comes in the form of mineral pellets that just have to disolve.|0
Although organic fertilizers are much better for the soil, there is no real food safety concern around non-organic fertilizers.|0
I think it is important to note that agriculture does not have to be viewed as organic versus conventional.|0
Conventional farming uses many methods that organic farmers use and vice versa.|0
Thus, they expect organic eggs to be brown, and most organic egg producers will keep breeds of chickens that lay brown eggs to confirm to that.|0
There are many online organic stores are available across India, if you still do not believe on organic products, certifications are fake.|0
A 2012 meta-analysis (a study examining lots of other studies to make an overall conclusion) found zero benefits to eating organic, for example.|n
"Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds You talk about ""exposure,"" but exposure to what?"|p
it is an organic pesticide!|0
It refers to Bacillus thuringiensis , a bacteria found on the surfaces of leaves, on soil, in drinking water, etc.|0
The bacteria makes a toxin, cry , that kills insects and is harmless to humans.|p
Take actual Bt bacteria and dump them on a plant, and that is organic.|0
You cannot limit exposure to it regardless of what you eat, but since it is proven harmless to humans, it does not matter . |0
Hence why I said the terms do not matter.|0
Your organic food is just as [un]likely to poison or harm you as GMOs; sometimes in a different way, sometimes in the exact same way!|0
Organic flour - Apply regular fertilizers, for example, excrement or manure, to bolster soil and plants.|0
Utilize bugs and feathered creatures, mating interruption or traps to lessen nuisances and ailment.|0
Turn crops, till, hand weed or mulch to oversee weeds.|0
Shower bug sprays to decrease nuisances and sickness.|0
According to USDA Organic Production ERS data, 2011 had 5.3 million acres of USDA Certified Organic farmland, with 3 million of that cropland and the other 2.3 million rangeland.|0
0.002% of total land mass in the US is organically farmed.|0
0.006% of all farmland is organically farmed using USDA Certified Organic certification, yet Organic products accounted for 4% of food sales according to Organic Market Overview . |0
There are three reasons for this that I can see; A) Certified Organic produce is typically more expensive.|n
B) Organic produce is more likely to see a human consumer than a pig or cow belly.|0
"C) The USDA slaps an organic label on anything that has 95% organic ingredients, a ""made with organic"" label on anything that has 70% organic ingredients, and anything that has any one of thousands of non-organically produced ingredients that are ""exceptions"", but may be expensive."|n
That is pretty difficult to answer, as “all the pesticides” used in conventional farming add up to many, many different kinds of chemical treatments, some with more residual activity in the environment than others, some more toxic than others.|n
But rather than get into so many details, I would pose the question back to you: What about all the pesticides used in organic farming?|0
If you are thinking that organic farming somehow equates to clean and happy and safe and natural food, think again.|0
For the majority of organic food out there, all it means is that a “natural” chemical pesticide has been substituted for a synthetic version.|n
Often times those “organic” pesticides are in fact far more harmful to the environment than their synthetic counterparts.|n
Organic, sadly, don’t mean much.|n
"In India i recommend <URL>"" , best online portal for all organic and natural products."|p
They sell only genuine organic natural products.|0
Brands like Orgra are direct from their panel farms, Orgra products are Millets, Rice, Wild Forest Honey, Siruthen Honey, Wood pressed oils, their price is affordable.|0
I started using only ORGRA products now.|0
O Greenz is a brand providing real organic vegetables and fruits, their taste is exceptional, i questioned about the authenticity of their products.|p
"Im a big fan of <URL>"" - India’s Largest Online Organic Store."|0
If you define it purely from an environmental standpoint, of course forests and permaculture systems are better.|p
The Rodale Institute is not particularly respected among serious agronomists (I have plenty of friends who work on organic ag, and do not care for them).|0
For example, their much publicized conventional vs. organic experiments use obsolete and destructive 50 year old techniques such as conventional tillage with moldboard plows.|0
"To be ""certified organic"" requires more than not treating the cows with rBST."|n
It means many stringent requirements are met.|p
In the USA, this includes ensuring the cows are fed organically grown feed, which means no pesticides or fertilizers.|p
New rules ensure the cows are kept outside in pastures for a certain period of time and fed a certain amount of grass (their natural diet) instead of just grains (their common feed).|p
Source: USDA imposes new standards for milk to qualify as organic This is not necessarily good for cows: being out in the pasture can be deadly in the wrong climates, such as overly rainy or cold ones.|0
And not giving cows antibiotics, while great in reducing antibiotic-resistance caused from over-medication, is downright cruel if the cow is genuinely sick and antibiotics would cure it.|n
The requirements for organic food are strict, and not necessarily in the cow's best interest, but there is no question current factory farming is no fun for the cows.|n
If the non-organic milk is rBST free, that might mean the farm where the cows are raised is caring for their cows' well-being but cannot quite meet all the requirements.|p
Let's say you do not care about cows and just care for your own health.|p
There is a mountain of evidence that organic foods provide zero benefit to the consumer on a medical or nutritional basis.|n
There is a lot of fearmongering out there to get you to eat organic: Big Organic is just as greedy a corporate entity as any other.|n
Regular milk is just as healthy, or organic milk just as unhealthy as conventional milk depending on how you feel about dairy.|n
"Plus, food poisoning is always more likely if you eat organic, especially ""raw milk,"" which is almost up there with cigarettes as a poison marketed by its lobby as healthy."|n
Page on Foodsafetynews Summary: Organic is expensive, probably better for the cows, and potentially better for the environment, but is not better for you.|n
If you feel paying extra for the same product is worth it, do so, but it is no different from buying an expensive brand name when a generic product is just as good.|n
People care about organic food as they believe (often but not always correctly) that it is healthier for them.|0
In comparison humanely raising animals is about animal health.|0
It is an ethical issue for humans not a health issue.|n
It is an ethical issue for humans not a health issue.|0
Many people are not aware or do not care or worry about the lives of the animals they eat but many people are concerned with their own health.|n
In order to farm organically, the farmer needs to make sure that the soil remains healthy.|0
Organic farming also releases less toxic chemicals into the environment.|p
"""Organic farming helps provide a safer, more healthy environment by: 1) not polluting our groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans with pesticides and chemical fertilizers; 2) reducing soil erosion; 3) improving soil quality; 4) increasing the diversity of wildlife on and near farms; and 5) providing safer working conditions for farm laborers (no exposure to pesticides)."""|p
(Small Planet Foods) However, it can be argued that *just* eating organic food, without also becoming vegetarian, is an exercise in futility.|0
"""Organic crop farming cannot support conventional meat and dairy production, nor can it support the production of organic animal products."|n
"Substituting organic animal products for conventional ones, without a drastic reduction in consumption, clearly is not a reasonable large-scale plan."""|n
Eating organic fruits, vegetables and animal products (if you are not vegan) is also healthier *for* you, as it reduces your exposure to pesticides and other poisons.|p
I eat organically because the food resourced from trusted sources, and they are less harmful for the environment.|p
Most importantly, for me, organic farming is giving me guilt-free feeling, when it comes the treatments of the animals and plants involved.|p
If you can afford it, its a great idea to switch to organic milk!|p
For one, the cows are fed organic (no pesticide) feed and not given routine anti-biotics.|p
No antibiotics in their daily feed means they have to be fed mainly grass and are much healthier than corn-fed cows who get highly acidic and get all sorts of sores and ulcers and other nasty stuff (that's why the anti-biotics in daily feed).|p
No Rbst helps with this, as one reason to overfeed cows on corn is to pump them with artificial hormones to get more milk.|p
No hormones, less feed, less sores and disease in your milk cows and in your milk.|p
Milk concentrates pesticides because fat concentrates pesticides.|p
Organic feed avoids this.|p
Big plus for healthy people and babies.|p
It tastes sooooo much better!|p
And its so much more refreshing to drink.|p
Your body knows whats good for it.|p
Some organic milk is better than others.|p
Suggest you get a few types and see which you like.|p
I personally like Strauss milk (whole foods) best, although Trader Joe's is good too.|p
I agree with you about organic food.|0
There is only one that I know of where there is a real and discernible difference to the consumer, other than it being more expensive.|n
That one is organically farmed Scottish salmon.|0
The fish are farmed further out to sea than conventional fish farms and each fish has more space in which to swim.|p
The organic meat has come from certified farms where no chemicles were put on the land to fertilise it that the animal had eaten being reared, the organic cow pig lamb or veal was not reared on feed containing chemicles and neither were they given antibiotics.|p
One thing I have heard is if you are only going to supplement your groceries with one or two organic items it should be dairy due to the rigorous standards that must be applied to the entire supply chain.|0
For example, according to the Organic Trade Association, for dairy products to be considered organic the animals are treated more humanely than many of their non-organic kind, are fed organic feed and given no preventative antibiotics or hormones.|p
Organic food has the two types Certified,Non-certified I am going to talk here only about Certified Organic food Organic systems rely on more expensive, natural ways of producing foods with the nutrients you are looking for.|0
Labor and transportation costs Distribution chains are very less In food production Health risks to farmers Environmental enhancement and protection ( Example -higher prices of organic cash crops compensate for low financial returns of rotational periods which are necessary to build soil fertility) Higher standards for animal welfare Credits- Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|0
Let's see: - way less toxins: no artificial pesticides, fertilizers, heavy metals, herbicides or pollution-related substances - no GMOs - no growth hormones - animals growing in decent conditions: enough space, sunlight - animals eating organic food Much than enough incentives IMO.|p
"The claim is that an organic cow will be given ""real"" drugs when sick enough."|0
Unfortunately, this renders her irreversibly not-organic, halves her value, and requires her immediate departure.|0
And I am not sure which is worse- denying the animal modern medicine for shallow selfrighteous ideals, or espousing those ideals and decrying conventional farming practices simply for the sake of projecting a false image.|n
It does sound like an exercise in trying to make humans feel better, rather than making milk in a healthy and efficient manner.|n
I have a feeling Alice in Wonderland would be agog at such irrationality, but you must do what the market rewards.|n
And organic milk sounds so smooth; it would be a nice label to wear.|p
Organic egg production is the production of eggs through organic means.|0
In this process, the poultry are fed organic feed.|0
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, organic means that the laying hens must have access to the outdoors and cannot be raised in cages.|0

Sure we understand that pesticides can contaminate the food and in turn us, but then that is why most people who are 40 plus are consuming food and drinks that are antioxidants to turn that frown upside down and undo all their unhealthy eating and drinking we have done in our younger lives and to a lesser quantity STILL DO!|p
I am not going down without a fight AND I will also protect “my people” by feeding them well and healthy food.|p
The movies I have highlighted and others show how hideous the general food making process is and how poisonous it is to our bodies, so other than the cost and in some cases the more limited supply of organic food availabile to us, we will levitate to it in a (very healthy rhythmic) heart beat.|p
Here's another fact (in my opinion - you be the judge - I challenge you): Organic food, in most cases does taste different - I’d go so far as to say better.|p
Personally and in my family, we migrated toward organic for most vegetables and the chicken, beef and eggs for me are hands down more flavorful.|p
Fruit just does not seem to have the same supply levels but it is getting better.|n
I will continue to “PC” organic food with my family and slip it into their diet.|p
I am looking for a Vulcan approach to living long and prospering for my loved ones and organic plays a part in that plan.|p

"Conventional vs. organic farming The word ""organic"" refers to the way farmers grow and process agricultural products, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products and meat."|0
Organic farming practices are designed to encourage soil and water conservation and reduce pollution.|p
Farmers who grow organic produce do not use conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds.|p
Examples of organic farming practices include using natural fertilizers to feed soil and plants, and using crop rotation or mulch to manage weeds.|0
I live in Baja California and I can tell you that it is small.|n
The reason organic produce is offered in the area I live in is because of the American Expats that live down here.|0
So, if you are planning on selling anything organic, make it in area where there is lots of retired gringos who have money (San Miguel de Allende is an example).|n
I can say though that for the organic produce that is available, it is way more cheaper than what it is being sold for in the U.S.|0
Most of the organic clothing is made in India.|p

There is such a thing as organic wine and wine made from organically grown grapes.|p
That distinction is made in the US.|0
The primary difference sulfites are not allowed to be added to 'organic wines' In Europe they do not make that distinction - organic is how the grapes are grown.|0
To my palate, an organic wine made without added sulfites, has a very different flavor profile and will not live very long, compared to other wines.|0
That said, I get fewer hangovers or sleep problems when I drink biodynamic wines - organically grown plus...|p

For instance, cheap hot dogs and lunch meat are organic.|n
Maybe it is not the parts you would prefer to eat of an animal, and perhaps they are not the best choices for quality meat, but it all comes from animals.|n
And let's examine potato chips; they are organic, too.|n
They come from real potatoes.|n
They may get fried within an inch of their lives and coated in salt, but they all came from real potatoes.|n
Organic merely means it came from a living organism, as opposed to being synthesized in a lab with barrels of chemicals from duPont.|n
For a food to be labeled organic, it must not be genetically modified, and it cannot be treated with synthetic pesticides, herbicides or preservatives.|p
There are organic pesticides, made from plants; so it does not mean there are no pesticides.|p
It is heavily influenced by marketing strategy; there is no evidence that suggests it is healthier.|n
In my opinion, we should not grow organic food; if the world switched to organic farming, we would not be able to feed our growing population.|n
I heard a statistic of 4% of all foods sold is of organic origin.|0
And with the corrupt certified organic commission slapping their labels on every thing who can tell.|n
When big buesness and big money get involved it tends to corrupt the procced.|n
Here are the primary reasons to eat organic food.|p
Organic food is in nowadays.|p
With a lot more people choosing to live the healthy life, it’s quite normal to have people making healthier food choices.|p
If yes is your answer, then you must learn to develop a loving relationship with organic food.|p
Organic food is the way to go when living a healthy life - it’s not only agriculturally grown in the most environmentally sensitive manner, it also shields you from harmful toxins often associated with genetically modified organisms and conventionally grown foods.|p
Organic Food Versus Genetically Modified Organisms Organic Food Production Is Better Organic Food is an Excellent Food Choice If you want the best source of organic food in Singapore, you’re in the right place!|p
Nature’s Glory is the name you can trust when it comes to organic food supply and delivery.|p
A general observation is that yes, they are worth it.|p
They are pesticide and chemical free fruits, no residual coatings on the actual fruit from poison and they are also grown in soil of the same nature.|p
Mostly they taste better, have a higher vitamin content/ increased nutritional value and they have not been force fed with superphosphate fertilisers which in the long run just tires out the soil and compromises quality.|p
The soil they are grown in is richer with biodynamic material, which as a whole, not only improves the fruit quality, but is alot better on our environment aswell.|p
Ultimately organic is healthier for both us and the planet.|p
The question seems to assume there is some nutritional difference between organic and conventional.|0
But if there is anybody being duped it is people spending double on organic for no good reason.|n
Organic foods are foods produced by methods that comply with the standards of organic farming.|0
Standards vary worldwide, however organic farming in general features practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.|0
Organizations regulating organic products may choose to restrict the use of certain pesticides and fertilizers in farming.|0
In general, organic foods are also usually not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents, or synthetic food additives.|0
Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and many other countries require producers to obtain special certification in order to market food as organic within their borders.|0
Although the produce of kitchen gardens may be organic, selling food with the organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) or European Commission.|0
There is no sufficient evidence in medical literature to support claims that organic food is safer or healthier than conventional food.|n
While there may be some differences in the nutrient and anti-nutrient contents of organically and conventionally produced food, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results.|0
Claims that organic food tastes better are generally not supported by evidence|n
Organic food is over 50% higher in vitamins and minerals and overall nutrients than non-organic food.|p
You would have to eat at least two apples to get the vitamins one organic apple supplies.|p
This is the reason consumers buy more organic food.|p
I worked in a grocery store produce department for years, and the organic apples always went bad at the drop of a hat.|n
A refrigerated non-organic apple will keep for months (although it may dry out a bit).|0
There is very little, or perhaps no reason to spend the exorbitant money to buy milk labelled “organic.” Analysis of the milk will reveal there is virtually no difference that is significant enough to be measured in any meaningful way.|n
If you seriously care about your health and the health of your family, take the financial savings realized from buying regularly collected and marketed milk and spend it on a good routine of serious exercise (weight training or resistance machines) and work out 3 times a week enough to generate a head to toe sweat.|0
Put your money to work in better ways than organic foods.|n
Non-organic fruit tends to look larger and more aesthetically appealing, but organic fruit tends to be more tasty and flavourful.|p
However according to the USDA there is no nutritional difference.|n
People asking about organic milk are often thinking unprocessed milk.|0
Serving non-organic food is not illegal, so it is not possible for such a requirement to exist.|0
I will however agree with the idea that it would be nice to have organic options wherever you dine.|p
Unless an ingredient that is used in a commercial kitchen is certified organic / wild caught (for fish) / grass fed and free pastured (for meat), I assume that most likely it is filled with hormones, antibiotics, pesticides and GMOs.|p
Unless the restaurateur is truly passionate about the food served at the restaurant, or really wants to optimize the flavors in the food for a higher-end clientele (in which case for example grass fed meats can make a big difference in flavor for those seeking them out), or the concept of the restaurant is such, the ingredients to be sourced will be the cheapest possible in order to maximize profits.|p
With that said, and as described in your linked article that authorities do not do much to protect us from unhealthy foods, it would be nice to see such a requirement implemented.|p
Perhaps one day, if public awareness is raised to a high enough level..|p
For vegetables, you definitely want to go organic.|0
"Though ""organic"" is also a bit of marketing."|0
You are safe if you know the farmer does not use pesticides.|0
If fruit is picked from small groves that do not use pesticides, you are usually pretty safe regardless of labeling.|n
The organic industry does nothing to fight the misinformation spread by those who profit from it, and indeed profit from it themselves.|n
The food grown with the certified organic label -is- grown with pesticides for one (herbicides are a type of pesticide).|n
There is a list of organic approved pesticides, usually because they are derived from natural sources.|0
This does not, however, make them safer for the consumer or the environment.|n
These pesticides are less effective than synthetic pesticides, and often need to be used in larger quantities in order to be effective.|n
This is an instance where the organic industry and those who sell the organic lifestyle have actively LIED to you.|n
Chemophobia is a terrible thing) There is no good evidence that organic is more nutritious than conventionally grown counterparts.|n
Organic food does not eliminate toxins from the body.|n
As for taste, that is subjective.|0
If you like the taste of organic food better, then great!|0
There is no significant difference in nutrition between organic and conventional.|n
Recent research conducted on organic milk has shown that it has more antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, CLA, and vitamins than non-organic milk.|p
Organic food is typically healthy, but has no nutritional or health advantages over any conventional food.|p
It is also generally much more expensive.|n
So it’s bad for economy, and a wash on health.|n

Organic protein powder has less lactose content than milk.|p
This is why organic protein powder is a suitable protein source for anyone suffering from lactose intolerance.|p
Those who suffer from severe lactose intolerance should use an organic whey isolate powder.|p
There is no gainsaying that organic protein powder is an amazing essential food supplement for anyone who wants to lose weight and build a lean and smart physique.|p
The finding by the university of Maryland Medical Centre has shown the benefits of Omega-6 fatty acids arising from grass fed milk compared to the industrial milk.|p
These and other studies go a long way to show the benefits of organic protein powder over non-organic protein powder.|p
These and other studies go a long way to show the benefits of organic protein powder over non-organic protein powder.|n
Here is my take, go organic.|p
Organic foods ONLY?|0
Organic foods are great, do not get me wrong-- and if you want a strictly organic diet that is up to you and there is nothing wrong with it.|0
If you want to maintain an organic diet, do not cut out ALL non-organic foods.|0
it is not a matter of organics having no nutritional advantage, but that organics do not pose a nutritional disadvantage . |0
That is the main advantage of organics.|p
"Although if we are talking about nutritional advantages, it does state here ( Health Benefits of Organic Food | Organic Facts ) that organic foods have higher levels of anti-oxidants."|p
I also do not have any data to support my opinion, but I wholly agree with Alexandra that feeding your children organic food is something you cannot put a price on.|p
However, I understand that constantly buying all of your food organic can really add up and become extremely expensive.|p
That is why I am suggesting that you only have to buy some of your food organic.|0
"So, organic food (or ""biological food"" as they call it in Europe) is the only option left to get good quality food."|p
It is not only that organic food contains more vitamin C, other antioxidants and nutrients; the body needs to detoxify what is in non-organic food and in the process may develop autoimmune disease: The Nutritional Benefits of Organic Fruits and Vegetables . |p
Granted, organic farmers also need to use some more user-friendly insecticide chemicals like copper sulfate.|0
But overall we are better off using as much organic produce as we can get.|p
Eating organic fruits and vegetables can have many benefits for a persons overall health.|p

I want to believe that if a store is claiming to sell organic, it is actually organic (at least the store thinks it is organic.|p
Maybe they were also fooled by the distributor/farmer).|n
But I believe (in the USA anyway), that foods marked with the USDA Organic label will most likely meet most standards for being organic.|p
Looks like this: Although then you get into the whole debate about exactly how the USDA regulates their standards.|0
In the end, you will never 100% know whether something is actually organic (humans have the unfortunate habit of lying to benefit themselves), you can just arm yourself with as much knowledge as possible so you can make educated guesses.|n
Here are some great resources to learn more about the various food labels in grocery stores: What Do Food Labels Really Mean?|0
The term “organic” is specifically a marketing term, and doesn’t have anything to do with food quality, safety, or environmental impact - it simply involves certification that the regulatory requirements were fulfilled to obtain a certificate for labelling.|0
Certification is quite expensive, so much qualifying food does not carry the label.|0
Markets like Trader Joes and Whole Foods do NOT claim to be 100% organic markets.|0
What food they sell that is labeled organic (or contains ingredients labeled as organic), is almost certainly compliant.|p
This is just a loaded marketing term, which in reality stands for more expensive food of lesser quality.|n
Technically, as per USDA laws, certified organic products can have up to 5% non-organic stuff.|n
A product is completely organic only if the label says '100% organic'.|0
This is all as per the laws framed by USDA and FDA.|0
And, USDA does allow the use of antibiotics while the cow is pregnant.|0
This can get absorbed in its meat and can have residues in milk.|0
I have got food from online organic shops in India and there is nothing clear to say that they are organic or not and what makes them organic.|n
Organic Fruit and Vegetables are certififed by different certifying bodies and the growers pay for this certification and guarantee.|0
Be careful about the labelling as sellers may sell organic and also sell non-organic produce.|n
I will only pay the extra if it has a 3rd party stamp from an IOAS accredited organic producer - the USDA is watered down and almost meaningless.|n
I do not see anything DDT-grade on that list, but in particular the non-organic dyes could in theory have all sorts of contaminants, so that is a loophole for non organic produce and herbicides/pesticides to be slipped in.|n
Processed foods sold as “organic” premium goods by large corporations cashing in, companies such as Kraft etc… sure it is not driven by anything other than profiteering.|n
What is the certification log on on the product?|0
Is it USDA certified organic?|0
The process of certification for organic foods that are USDA certified organic is regulated by the National Organic Program.|0
There are many organizations that can certify foods as organic following the standard set by the NOP, which is under the US Department of Agriculture.|0
Eighty four certifying agents are currently USDA-accredited and authorized to certify operations to the USDA organic standards.|0
Of these, 49 are based in the U.S. and 35 are based in foreign countries.|0
Most certifying agents are directly accredited by the USDA National Organic Program (NOP).|0
Twenty additional certifying agents are authorized through recognition agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments.|0
You can read more about this on the USDA - NOP program website: USDA Accredited Certifying Agents So yes, foods coming from Mexico can be certified organic.|0
The USDA certification is a 3rd party independent certification, which means it is not the company producing the food that verifies that the food meets this standard, it is an independent 3rd party certification.|p
This is the highest standard and verification there is for an organic claim.|p
To be more exact: USDA Certified Organic has <5% GMOs.|p
"Supply-chains are incredibly complex, and keeping things perfectly separate is economically unfeasible (same idea as ""may contain traces of nuts"")."|0
"<URL>"" It gets a little more complicated with processed foods with many ingredients: Is Organic Always GMO Free?"|0
"Finally, note that ""organic"" has various definitions across markets."|0
USDA Certification is just one, but it was created to have a clear and consistent standard.|p
The EU, for example, is more stringent.|0
There is no requirement to label organic foods, so any producer who does so is doing so purely for advertising purposes.|n
Organic does not always mean healthier.|0
Further, organic does not guarantee things like pesticide free.|0
If I were a tea drinker I would be more prone to use teas that are grown in an environmentally sound manner (organic can help with that) and fair trade versions.|p
"I should note international imports using the term ""made with organic"" must meet the USDA guidelines."|0
These guidelines includes the stipulation that the product is composed of 70% organic ingredients.|0
"If it is labeled ""organic"" it must contain 95% organic ingredients."|0
Many of these brands that you have mentioned are 100% organic and they are certified.|p
If you have doubts then you may visit their websites or the certifying agency websites and check for the certification, validity, etc.|n
It is also important to buy from Organic stores /shops - who carry multiple brands and unbranded organic stuff, the store people come to know any such problem.|0
Once a person is a consumer of Organic products, means that person is a consumer with awareness.|p
Odwalla has some organic ingredients in their smoothies|p
They have too much money to spend on food.|n
They gullibly buy the hype around marketing buzz words like organic and natural.|n
There is not a better store nearby.|p
Since Organic is more of a political and sales term than a technical one, it likely boils down to if the restaurant advertises this or not.|n
Since organic ingredients are more expensive, restaurants hope to make back their investment by communicating the choices they have made.|n
If the restaurant does not mention organic ingredients, chances are it is not organic.|n
You can always ask your server or chef where they get their ingredients.|0
Bertrand is USDA / organic certified.|0
That said, at Ambronite, we’ve thought about this, but have realised we get the same quality, and in some cases, better quality ingredients without the organic stamp.|n
We comply with organic regulations and are inspected by Finnish Organic Inspection body Evira (FI-EKO-201).|0
But buying something made with organically grown ingredients by a responsible farmer is probably better overall for the environment.|p
No, there is no noticeable difference in taste or health from organic food.|n
Organic food production is much better for the environment though.|p
"Much more doubtful if ""organic"" have real health benefits."|n
it is much more an attempt to make agriculture sustainable long-run.|p
Traces of pesticide mostly do not matter much.|0
I think organic does taste a little better.|p
There are serious ecological implications to eating organic that I think are actually even more important than the taste.|0
These are the some of the benefits of eating organic fruits and vegetables: Antioxidant capacity.|p
Pesticide reduction.|p
It keeps the heart healthy.|p
It helps in immune system.|p
Increases Antibiotic resistance.|p
Environmental saftey.|p
Better nutrition.|p
Less chances of food-borne illness.|p
Better for your Conscience.|p
And the environmental impact of “organic” is worse.|0
please read this article for brief details about organic food.|n
Organic Food: Healthier for this planet.|p
Is organic food healthier?|0
In general, it is not demonstrated that organic food is healthier than conventional food.|0
Research on individual products shows that organic products are generally less residues of pesticides contain and sometimes less nitrates than conventional products.|p
Both regular and organic products are safe to use.|p
Differences in composition Some organic products have higher levels measured in vitamin C, minerals and bioactive substances.|p
Also, the fatty acid composition of can milk be different.|p
It contains more polyunsaturated fatty acids (CLA, omega-3), beta-carotene and vitamin E. This is true for all the cows with grazing.|p
However, it is impossible to say how big the differences between organic and conventional products will be exactly.|0
The variation between organic products is large and this also depends on the season, region and varieties used.|0
Healthy eating pattern is not dependent on the first product Further defines not a single product but the composition of the total package food and drink for someone to take it to them, how healthy is his diet.|0
For your health is not a must to eat organic.|0
Shaft you on animal welfare, the environment, climate and nature want to watch are organic products a good choice.|p
Speaking only for myself, I buy organically-grown food not because I expect immediate or even eventual health benefits for me personally, but because in the long run it is better for the soil and for the whole web of life that supports us.|0
Speaking only for myself, I buy organically-grown food not because I expect immediate or even eventual health benefits for me personally, but because in the long run it is better for the soil and for the whole web of life that supports us.|p
Organic growing or even organically-leaning growing supports the growth of beneficial soil microorganisms and the balance of all the life surrounding the garden or farm - insects, birds, small mammals, carnivores, and the humans who are not separable from this web.|p
I used to eat organic food because I believed that organic agriculture was less environmentally damaging than conventional.|0
I no longer feel compelled to purchase organic products for environmental considerations.|0
However, I still sometimes buy organic food if a product that I like happens to be organic.|0
Organic food itself does not have a significant positive impact on the environment.|n
However, when compared to it is alternative, which is industrial farm practices, it does in the form of far lower CO2 emissions and non-polluted soil which also assists in clean water streams and so on.|p
"""Organic agriculture"" once implied the promotion of natural soil, plant, and animal health, and production without using synthetic inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides."|0
"Most of the grocers' organic products do not come from sustainable systems, but they surely are produced intensively and are legally labeled ""organic""."|n
If organic agriculture is more sustainable than intensive agriculture, why does it cost so much more at the grocery store?|n
Organic agriculture cannot match the productivity of conventional agricultural because of the nitrogen problem: conventional again uses artificially fixed nitrogen, while a true organic system uses legumes in rotation to fix nitrogen.|n
"By and large, ""organic"" produce is no different than conventionally grown produce, and the methods are no more sustainable."|n
"The ""certified organic"" label does allow retailers to charge higher prices, making up for the higher costs of production and lower yields."|n
Mainly, organic products cannot be subjected to pesticides/herbicides, synthetic hormones/antibiotics or chemical fertilizers.|0
Losses are more likely, and yields tend to be less predictable.|n
It seems self-defeating to preserve organic food with inorganic preservative agents, so shelf-life is reduced while the cost of storage/transport is increased due to spoilage.|n
Proponents of organic food argue that it is tastier and healthier, so that is an oppertunity to charge an additional premium.|p

Organic food makes a series of claims about nutrition and pesticide residue.|0
"While the overuse of chemical pesticides and herbicides, and the use of specific pesticides like DDT deserve some skepticism the marketing jargon of ""organic"" seems to be a poor tactic."|n
Organic is largely a lazy way for suburbanites to avoid encountering the realities of food production.|n
It is almost pure marketing and produces such significantly smaller yields (about 34% less, but context dependent) that it is not sustainable as a way to feed a world population.|n
Generally the yield is lower.|0
Its also a misconception that organic farmers do not use pesticide or fertilizer.|n
They do - the pesticides and fertilizers just have to be of organic origin..|0
The criteria for organic origin are somewhat arbitrary.|0
I have worked in processing plants that ran organic foods.|0
Farmers that grow organic can charge a higher price to compensate for their reduced yield, and this guy can afford to pay extra if it makes him feel better.|0
Farmers that grow organic can charge a higher price to compensate for their reduced yield, and this guy can afford to pay extra if it makes him feel better.|n
You see, in an organic processing plant, the water that is used to clean the food is recirculated.|0
But with organic it just keeps building up until the water is so dirty that it makes the produce more dirty than when it came in.|n
I understand you want organically-grown foodstuffs to be healthier than foodstuffs grown by the usual suspects.|n
But, consider, even if it is upheld as the wholefoods truth, would organic farming sustain an entire planet's population?|n
One of the criterion for Organic food is the rejection of chemical fertilization and pesticides.|p
Without those, several forms of primary crops will become very hard to cultivate at the scale we are currently producing.|n
"I would not be surprised the yield for corn, rice and wheat will fall by half or even more, however if people are serious about having ""organic"" qualification for their food, i am sure technology and infrastructure can be build up."|n
"I would not be surprised the yield for corn, rice and wheat will fall by half or even more, however if people are serious about having ""organic"" qualification for their food, i am sure technology and infrastructure can be build up."|p
Organic production is generally a bit less productive on a per acre basis, but that does not mean that it will always be this way.|n
Because to grow any crop the nutrients requrement is same whil food that are produced naturally without using any chemicals that required large amount of organic fertilizer and it always yield less upto 50% than producing food by using chemical.|n
It free from toxic substaces or residul of chemical.|p
It more healthy.now a days the demand is more So it brcomes more costly|p
It more healthy.now a days the demand is more So it brcomes more costly|n
You are right, the yield is low.|n
The natural manure like compost and cow dung etc collection and preparation takes lot of time and effort, hence organic food is costly.|n
It is very important to chose organic.|p
Though the chemicals are used in very less amount still some amount of residue is left over which have an adverse effect after consumption.therefore prefer not to have inorganic teas.|p
The only difference between conventional and organic is who decides what chemicals can be used in their respective production.|0
"Under the National Organic Standards Act, farmers and other organic proponents politically appointed to the National Organic Standards Board decide which chemicals can be used in ""organic"" production."|0
Thus far these have included toxic chemicals like rotenone, pyrethrin and copper sulfate.|n
Some call these natural but remember, at its base, we all live in a chemical world and dose makes the poison.|n

Foods bearing it are required to be grown, harvested, and processed according to national standards that include restrictions on amounts and residues of pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics.|p
Notice it does not say no pesticides and no hormones, just that there are restriction on which ones and how they can be used to qualify as organic.|0
Locally sourced organically produced food tastes better.|p
Just because something is labeled organic does not automatically make it better especially if you choose to buy your food from big box stores like Walmart or the others.|0
"There are no health benefits to consuming ""organic"" food."|n
Seems a bit strange to eat organic and then do synthetic recreational pharmas, or drink bad beer, or drive when you could walk.|0
Organic is not worth the cost.|n
Organic food is disgusting, I have written about it here: Josh Manson's answer to What do you think about people who buy and eat only organic food?|n
All natural is worth buying though.|0
All natural means that the food has nothing artificial.|0
The price difference is much lower than that of organic, and the benefits are much more noticeable for the cost.|0
There are both white and brown organic eggs.|0
We have an organic group in my town called Deeper Roots that makes killer coffee.|p
it is all in when the bean was picked...Not it is organic label.|0
An egg will taste better if the chicken is happy and healthy and eating a good diet of grass and bugs.|p
It will taste better if the eggs are allowed to grow naturally (not induced by hormones to make more) It will taste better fresher.|p
Organic does not imply all of these.|n
I will take local produce over out of state produce, American produce over foreign produce, organic over conventional.|p
I do not buy organic if conventional is available.|n
While the jury is still out on this one, I agree with Ryan that the difference between nutrient levels in conventionally grown produce and organic fruits and vegetables would be very small indeed.|0
The fact that pesticide residue on organic goodies is lower, may be of greater importance.|p
Some studies have shown that the antioxidant content in organically grown fruits and vegetables may be slightly higher.|n
The theory is that, because organic produce grow without the use of pesticides, they develop more phytonutrients as a defense mechanism to keep them healthy.|p
However, other studies have not been able to replicate these findings, as reported in this New York Times article of 2012.|0
The bottom line is that in many instances organic produce does taste better and will reduce your exposure to pesticides.|p
The organic food will become relatively cheaper.|0
There might be some services also around organic food such as home delivery.|0
In Pune, I used to buy organic milk at Rs 75/- per litre because of the following reasons: - It was organic.|0
My first reply is YES we need to pay higher to organic ,if it produced by following the principals and practices of organic genuinely.|0
compost it may have better nutritional value as compared to conventionally (chemical) produced with few fertilisers and, off course no pesticide residue.|p
The difference between the organic beans and non-organic is in the way the plants were farmed.|0
Your reason for buying organic should be because organic techniques are better for the environment.|p
I prefer organic dried beans.|p
"There is zero nutritional advantage to ""organic"" foods."|n
They just cost more.|n
"there is no guarantee that ""organic"" means they do that well, either."|n
"The only difference between organic beans and conventional beans (I hate the term ""non organic""- beans are organic to start) is that the former will make a bigger dent in your pocketbook than the latter."|n
Also, you might feel a smug sense of superiority when buying the former.|n
Now that we’ve cleared that up: organic agriculture produces crops, meat, and animal products (like eggs and dairy) without pesticides, herbicides, synthetic fertilizers, hormone supplements, genetic modifications, or antibiotics.|p
Instead, organic farmers use more natural methods, like fertilizing fields with compost and allowing their chickens to hunt for insects among the crops.|p
Whether it produces better or healthier food is debatable, but it’s certainly easier on the surrounding ecosystems.|p
And I personally think organic products taste better.|p
Industrial organic food is not really very natural.|n
"it is grown in monocultures and subjected to a lot of chemicals that strike me as not much more ""natural"" than the synthetic versions."|n
And they are usually using seed stocks that have been bred (conventionally) for durability rather than flavor.|n
There is a premium currently we are paying for organic or chemical free produce.|n
We at My Goodness Organic and Natural Store has seeds and garden based products.|0

How much are organic products going to cost, will that affect the prices you charge for meals and will people pay extra.|0
The main benefit is organic food is farmed with no pesticides.|p
To be certified USDA organic, 95% of the product must be free of pesticides, solvents, artificial colors and dyes, no chemical fertilizers.|0
The main downside is cost to the consumer.|n
The only benefit is psycological if you actually buy into the organic kool-aid.|n
There is no evidense whatsoever between organic and GMO.|n
ORGANIC DOES NOT MEAN HEALTHY!|n
Organic pesticides are not nearly as effective as traditional pesticides so farmers must use a lot more of it and bugs still attack it.|n
Washing pesticides off your produce is the best way to avoid consumption, whether it be organic or not.|0
However, chemicals used in organics have proven less effective and have the potential to cause a reemergence of problems that traditional chemicals have already fixed.|n
"The real benefit of organic food is the concept, ""you are what you eat."""|n
Organic food, at least in the US, has to meet certain criteria to receive its designation.|0
Bottom line for me...I cannot afford to eat 100% organic, but I do buy my veggies at the farmer's market.|n
In a nutshell, though, organic means the product meets a number of requirements, such as no GMOs, no non-organic pesticides, etc.|p
However, organic does not mean it is better for you, provides more nutrients, or is more healthy.|n
It just that the product meets some criteria and that it is more expensive.|n
Organic pesticides can be just as bad as synthetic ones, but they are perfectly okay to use.|n
Choosing organic generally puts a larger dent in your wallet but does not ensure that you are making the world a better place or that you are choosing the more healthy option.|n
"Manipulating the organic label occurs, much like people think ""all natural ingredients"" means a product is better."|n
I see that side of it too, that the risk of DDT complications from organic bananas is zero and the risk from non-organic bananas is something above zero.|p
The only con for organic is the extra $$$.|n
the Swedish Environmental Research Institute recently did a study and found that in Organic eggs there is more dixine and heavy metals than in normal eggs… Who likes organics reads only the positives never negatives.|n
Organic can be done only in greenhouses.|n

"The easiest way to decide is to check out the ""dirty dozen"" The New Dirty Dozen: 22 Foods to Eat Organic"|0
My advice: put the idea of organic food on hold, finish your studies, get a well paid job and when you can afford to pay the premium price of organic food make it your main source of alimentation.|n
Even though organic is more expensive, if your diet is mostly produce, your grocery bill would be lower than someone buying boxes of hamburger helper.|0
A surface answer to your question: Because people are not willing to pay for it.|n
People know that their health is important, but they do not demonstrate it in their spending.|n
People know that their health is important, but they do not demonstrate it in their spending.|p
A well balanced diet is what you should go for because when you go on a typical organic juice cleanse, you are not just wasting money on a lot of unnecessary foods but also adding a lot of extra vitamins that your body has to flush out.|p
The only benefot is making a company rich and draining your bank account.|n
Well you can loose weight by eating organic because you are more likely to contract a food borne illnesses from organics than you are from normal food.|n
USDA is the enforcement of organic labels, indicating certain things may or may not be done or not done.|0
Organic certified costs in inspections and meeting requirements.|0
Using organic practices is not organic certified.|0
it is not so much a matter that organic food (itself), is any better for your body than regular food.|0
it is more the fact that not ingesting a lot of pesticides, antibiotics, chemical fertilizers and preservatives does your health less harm.|p
The other main argument lies in the cost differential between organic and regular foodstuffs.|0
See: Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds Of course, even those findings are open to debate: Organic Food vs.|n
Eating organic on a budget takes planning.|n
If you just toss organic foods into your shopping cart willy-nilly, you’re in for some sticker shock when you get to the checkout.|n
Instead, start by thinking carefully about exactly which foods you want to buy organic.|0
Almost everyone would choose organic over non-organic foods,but organic food is a higher price typically because organic food is often produced on smaller scales,which cant really keep up with demand so prices are fairly high,and non-organic food is produced in large numbers so supply often keeps up with demand and prices stay low.|0
Many people feel strongly that organic food is, or is not, better for health and which is the truth will not be answered here.|0
If you believe that, go with the organic --- the price difference is not huge compared to your budget unless you are much poorer than I think.|p
If you want to support organic farming, a system of agriculture that many people strongly feel is better for the environment and for farm workers, go with the organic.|p
Everyone who wants to shift toward a greener and toxic-free living, dips into the organic diet.|0
Those of us who earn a modest income can find the prices of such organic food products exorbitant, which causes us to slide back to our old ways.|0
Organic products are considered healthy owing to the lack of chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in their production as well as to the best practices followed in preserving the ecological value of the land.|p
In India, a food product is deemed organic only when it is certified through the National Program for Organic Production (NPOP).|0
Buying organic food daily can be heavy on the pockets.|n
If he is well paid he could afford organic.|0
If he is smart he will not care if his food is organic or not.|0
You made me do some homework though because your stance that they are (organic pesticides etc) untested sounded a little strong to be honest.|p
Anyhow, I think this exerpt ssys it better than I did.. For instance, while organic farmers and food producers grow and produce food without using synthetic pesticides, herbicides, hormones, antibiotics and artificial fertilisers, certain naturally occurring pesticides or herbicides such as pyrethrins, light oils, copper and sulphur and biological substances are permitted for use in organic farming.|p
Therefore, it is still important to remember to wash all fruit and vegetables before consumption.|0
So basically then, based on what you are saying, organic fruits and vegetables are no safer than regular|0
That depends on the motivation of buying and eating purely organic food.|0
However if it is for the mistaken belief that organic food is healthier and 'better' for you, then no, because that is a fallacious assumption.|0
Test after test has shown virtually no difference in the nutritional value of organic food, yet test after test has shown that organic food can contain a far higher level of fungi and bacteria, especially on the skin.|0
Whilst these are not necessarily harmful in the short term, they are certainly of no benefit and can potentially pose long term health risks.|0
There has been no large, replicable studies that have shown any difference in safety between organic and nob-organic fruit.|n
If you want to consider pesticides a danger despite the majority of evidence pointing against it, then know that organic foods are much more dangerous.|n
Organic pesticides are much more toxic and dangerous to the environment then synthetic ones, and since they are not as effective they have to use more of them too.|n
Plus, organic foods are not as closely monitored as GMO foods, which leaves them more room to leave these pesticides on their produce.|n
Both organic milk and conventional milk are pure, safe and nutritious.|p
Both the milk contain the same essential nutrients--such as calcium, vitamin D and potassium.|p
Organic vegetables are fresher and it does not contain any pesticides.|p
Eating organic food help us to prevent from major and minor diseases.|p
Organic food is bit expensive in the market.|n
Buying from the market is little expensive.|n
Commercially grown organic vegetables have to meet or exceed the same food safety standards as conventionally grown vegetables.|0
Organic eggs are those produced by chicken which are kept in natural environment without use of any hormone to increase the production of eggs in chicken.|p
Organic eggs will always be costlier than those produced by use of hormone injection in chicken.|n
From the above its clear that organic eggs are safe to consume.|p
Bonus tips: Any organic products you see in market will be costlier and will be much safer for health.|p
Organic fruits and vegetables are very well known for the number of benefits for the overall health of the body.|p
Here are some of the well known facts that are required by the body that you can get from eating organic fruits and vegetables - Organic food does not contain GMO.|p
It is helpful in providing better nutrition to the overall health of the body.|p
The food grown organically does not contain any number of pesticides or herbicides that are known to be harmful for the body.|p
And a lot more benefits are there that you can get from adding organic foods to your daily food eating habits to get better health naturally.|p
In most countries, fresh fruit and vegetables are subject to random checks by the various food standards agencies to ensure that they do not contain excessive amounts of pesticides or any other potentially hazardous chemical residues.|p
Certainly as far as larger scale wholesalers and retailers are concerned, the risks of buying from unauthenticated suppliers is too great.|0
In fact you are statistically more likely to become ill from eating many types of organic produce, for the simple reason that naturally occurring fungal spores can grow on their surface after harvesting, and if the produce is left too long before consumption, these fungi, whilst still not visible to the naked eye, can reach potentially harmful levels.|0
But I must emphasise the incidence of this is low.|0
100% organic: All ingredients must be organic Organic: At least 95% of ingredients are organic; remaining ingredients must be approved substances Made with organic: At least 70% of ingredients are organic As mentioned earlier, you must be sure to read the labels to determine which percentage of organic content is actually contained within the food.|0
Requirements (Label) Organic - Manufacturers of organic dog food must follow specific guidelines that are governed by specific laws.|0
This is not to say that ‘natural’ dog food is all bad, but only to suggest that its’ contents are not all pure.|n
Some, if not most of natural pet food will contain added ingredients that are not entirely wholesome.|n
On the other hand, organic food, following specific mandated guidelines will not contain questionable ingredients.|p

I will tell you that there has been an increase in the popularity of organic dog food as pet owners become more educated with the nutritional value this food provides.|p
If you want to choose foods free from pesticides, then why do you choose organic?|p
Organic pesticides are just as toxic as regular ones.|n
They do in amounts of antioxidants.|p
Based on the study done by Professor Carlo Leifert in New Castle University in 2015 it seems organic foods are superior to conventional non organic by almost 18-69% in key antioxidants.|p
Note oxidation and resulting oxidants is one of the key processes leading to antibody development and further development of cancer, thus eating organic will let you stay clear the cancerous route as much as possible.|p
Minor and anecdotal thing but people reportedly say that organic has a more richer taste too.|p
I eat organic food because it is not treated with toxic pesticides.|p
Be aware of natural toxins.|n
Some vegetables produce toxins to fight the insects which are similar to the pesticides which are sprayed onto veges to control insects.|n
If the organic grower is selecting for vegetables that are resistant to insects they will contain a higher proportions of these toxins which are also harmful to us.|n
about the number of deaths due to pesticides compared to the number if only organic produce was available.|0
(lower consumption of fruit and vegetables due to higher cost of organic production, which means they are less affordable, results in higher cancer rates) and the deaths from the increased cancer rates was much higher.|n
Any fruit or vegetable where you are going to eat the skin you are going to want to buy organic.|p
So it is worth the extra money for apples, celery, lettuce, grapes, etc.|p
But fruits where you do not eat the skin, foods with peels, such as bananas, oranges, kiwi, avocado, onions, are not worth the extra money for organic.|n
Organic vegetables actually have more pests on them than do those treated with pesticides (Duh!).|0
That means you need to wash them even more if you intend to get rid of the pests that were not killed because no pesticides were used.|0
And yes, some people are concerned about residual pesticides, but that is another issue.|n
There is nothing about organic foods that prevents E. coli or salmonella from being transported on those foods.|n
Pesticides do not either, of course.|n

There is slightly higher exposure to pesticides from conventional produce, but simply washing fruits and vegetables before consumption would be an effective measure to substantially reduce pesticide exposure.|0
Higher antioxidant and lower cadmium concentrations and lower incidence of pesticide residues in organically grown crops: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses How can I wash pesticides from fruit and veggies?|p
From what i can find, there is no known health benefit from consuming organic produce instead of conventional produce: Organic food consumption and the incidence of cancer in a large prospective study of women in the United Kingdom Organic Food: Buying More Safety or Just Peace of Mind?|n
Lastly, consider that organic food has its own set of carcinogenic concerns.|n
There are a variety of organic-approved pesticides, and the only thing they have in common is that they have been around for a long time.|n
Nicotine sulfate and lime sulfur are just two examples of pesticides approved for use on organic crops that are carcinogenic.|n
And some studies have found that certain organic crops are more likely to have carcinogenic mold than their conventional counterparts.|n
there is no reason to think that organic foods are necessarily safer.|n
It must be reasonable to assume, that should there be a stable measurable difference in the nutritional content of organic food, different reviews would be able to arrive at that conclusion independently of each other.|n
Instead, we so far have four reviews on similar lines - finding no nutritional or health benefits of organic food.|n
Pesticide Residues on Organic: What Do We Know?|p

Organic wine: Organic wine is produced from grapes that are grown organically.|0
Organic cultivation excludes the use of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides.|0
There are more than 2,000 organic wine producers globally.|0
Since organic grape cultivation does not make use of any harmful chemicals, it is beneficial for both the environment and the crop.|p
However, since organic wine is prepared from organic grapes, it is free from pesticide residues.|p

The question was “Why is it imperative to you to eat organic food?”.|0
A basket of fruit and vegetables, a pesticide and an insecticide and said that you’d only make your food from one.|0
Organic is a bit different.|0
"The law that created ""organic"" in Anerica is known as the National Organics Program (NOP)."|0
"This is a document that outlines exactly what ""organic"" means in America and also made it a law that for you to label something ""organic"" you must be certified as stated in the document."|0
If I follow all the standards in NOP regarding agricultural methods but I do not go through the certification process then I can not sell my products as organic.|0
If I follow even more stringent standards then required by the NOP by I am not certified I still cannot call my products organic.|0
"Now as to what this really means, it is just a way for the large commercial farms to get into the ""organic"" market."|0
Small scale organic (and sustainable) farmers that do not have the money to be certified and re-certified every year cannot use the organic label.|0
These regulations generally do two things: 1) no GMO seed 2) no use of certain chemicals.|0
"Yes I did say ""certain"" chemicals because if it is on the approved list you can use it and a lot of them are manufactured chemicals that start with some non-petrochemical base and produce something that is useful through chemistry."|0
"""Organic"" without USDA certification is illegal and can mean anything, supposedly, though I tell people my produce is organic, I do not sell it in retail markets but directly to the customer."|0
My process is more stringent than the NOP but I can not legally label my produce organic in a retail market (and it is illegal for them to but from me anyway).|0
The argument in favor of washing produce is supported when the produce contains surface pesticides (typically because it is not organic, but there are some organic pesticides as well.)|0
If you are buying fruit or salad that is already in a box and cannot really really be touched by shoppers because it is protected by that box, and you have good reason to believe that the organic pesticides are nonexistent or not particularly harmful, eating that produce without washing it may well be beneficial.|0
Organic farming is a type of farming completely devoid of chemical fertilisers , pesticides, instead usage of green leaf manures, cow dung, neem, manure made through weeds etc is used for the farming.|p

Synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering may not be used.|0
To a chemist, an organic pesticide is one that contains carbon.|0
All pesticides regularly used in agriculture would be organic.|0
To a consumer, an organic pesticide might be a pesticide that comes from a natural source rather than industrial chemical synthesis (obviously, naturally occurring pesticides are chemically synthesized, but by living things).|0
"This has been used for decades by organic farmers, and it is the insecticide found in Monsanto's genetically modified ""Bt"" crops."|0
"They tried to use the marketing phrase ""all natural ingredients""."|0
"Using the word ""organic"" is fairly recent and it is a contrived marketing phase that stuck."|0
"Calling foods ""organic"" because they were produced without pesticides or antibiotics does not make a whole lot of sense, but it worked for marketing and became a new slang term."|0
In simple terms, Organic farming is a type of farming which completely eliminates the usage of chemicals i.e, chemical fertilizers, chemical pesticides,insecticides, everything that contains artificially produced chemicals.|p
In replacement to these,organically produced manures and fertilisers such as vermicompost,green manures, green leaf manures and organic pesticides and insecticides like neem foliar spray, neem kernal extracts,Panchakavya(made from 5 products of cow) Dashakavya(made by adding different species of leaves to panchakavya) are used.|0

'What is Organic?'|n
And people are not much aware of benefits of organic over the pesticide laden ones.|p
The answer is simple buddy , the resources used in organic agriculture are the natural waste and organic residues most of the times produced in our own farm ,and since the organic materials are 100% biodegradable the pollution caused by them is negligible.|p
Look at a list of most pesticide ridden fruits and vegetable, they are worth buying organic.|p
Do you have any sources for the claim that organic products contain less pesticides and ‘toxic metals’?|0
The point I am trying to make is that where your pesticides come from—organic or synthetic sources—does not change the fact that this method of growing (industrial, including organic industrial) relies heavily on chemical use either way.|n

Organic farming is slowly catching up in India, may be due to the hype created.|0
All farming practices a few hundreds of years ago were all organic, but inventions during the industrial revolution and population growth all lead to inorganic methods and usage of harsh chemicals in farming.|0
After realizing the ill effects of such chemicals we are now promoting organic farming methodologies.|p
Organic just means either no chemicals or no chemicals on the restricted chemicals list are present in the soil or the produce.|0
Most governments have lists of acceptable or inacceptable chemicals for organic certification.|0

The soil association has a set of rules about what can and cannot be used and if you want to produce food commercially which is labelled organic, you have to start following the soil association rules.|0
You need to follow them for a number of years in order for all the synthetic chemicals which have been used previously to dissipate and they will test your soil for synthetic residue.|0
After you get the all clear, you can label your produce organic for sale in the UK.|0
Amateur gardeners may use the term more informally bur even for them there is an organisation called Garden Organic which gives advice and gets members to participate in scientific trials of effective organic methods etc.|0
I am not sure how much of this applies outside the UK but there are pretty strict rules about what is considered to be organic though out the European Union . |0
Organic is kind of an all-encompassing prospect, with it more recently being used to refer to foods grown without added pesticides.|p
One of the arguments for organics being healthier is that we are not going to ingest those pesticides used in helping keep foods from getting eaten before reaping.|p
Everything we eat is organic in nature but not necessarily grown with organic conventions or the use of man made fertilizers and pesticides.|0
Experts at Consumer Reports believe that organic is always the best choice because it is better for your health, the environment, and the people who grow our food.|p

I try to get organic with just about everything, to minimize the toxic load in my system.|p
There are so many chemicals we cannot avoid (air we breathe) but there is a lot we can do about what we eat and other products we use, like lotions and stuff.|p
I do not know what condition would not allow you to remove dairy from your diet, so I cannot comment on that.|0
But no matter what, anything we can do to cleanse the toxins out of our system is going to help.|p
I am afraid science does not really support the health claims of organic produce.|n
I buy organic produce when it is imported, since organic often goes hand in hand with better worker conditions.|p
WRONG,properly grown organic has more minerals, vitamins, and many other factors in far greater abundance.|p
organic food keeps you health and Fit.|p
I see other people saying there needs to be evidence organic food is healthier...that's retarded.|n
Organic is a bit of a scam and no healthier than normal food.|n
"Also organic does not mean free of ""chemicals"": Some Pesticides Permitted in Organic Gardening"|n
"The term ""organic"" can mean a lot of different things, but by and large it indicates food that is grown without chemical pesticides, fertilizers or other additives."|0
there is a few reasons why growing food organically can be desirable... 1) Most grown food is harvested and processed by people.|0
Organically grown food reduces or eliminates the risk to those workers.|p
Organically grown food largely avoids these issues.|p
My wife and I have eaten mostly organic for years.|p
But it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why we feel that we have personally experienced benefits.|p
We have a lot of energy.|p
But you could blame this on our regular exercise program that we are also doing.|0
We do not have any major diseases that people in our age group develop.|0
We even have lost a significant number of friends from cancer who did not eat organic food.|p
Detailed blood tests remain very good including triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol.|p
Conceptually we feel that we do not want to poison ourselves with regular food, so we buy organic.|p
We are aware that this may be not the perfect answer, but it is a better answer than going to fast food restaurants every day.|p
We rather cook organic at home.|p
And no offense at my observation, but I do see how it can be effective if you truly believe that organic food is substantially different.|0
Yes, My health has been improved a lot after I switch to organic diet, but it is little difficult to habituate to it.|p
I can digest organic food easily 2.|p
More nutrients and vitamins gave some glow to my face and skin 3.|p
My Stamina has been improved.|p
I am able to walk more distance without fatigue.|p
I can sleep happily|p
Therefore with or without studies organic food is healthier.|p
Have you any evidence for the proposition that organic food is healthier?|0
I believe in consumer choice, so if people want to waste money and valuable agricultural land on organic food, they should have the choice.|n
But the government should definitely not subsidise it in any way.|n
Yes, organic food is really good for your body.|p
They have following benefits: It increases energy.|p
The best place to order organic veggies and groceries is undoubtedly Uorganica.|0
They have huge range of health food like millets and other organically produced products.|p
Organic/inorganic does not affect nutrition.|0
Organic food is good for our bodies because originally, all food was organic.|p
But if you eat processed foods, fried foods, fast foods or other unhealthy foods eating a few organic meals will not make a difference in your health.|0
Soybeans (68g protein/cup) NOTE: I would opt for the organic variety if you want to avoid GMOs because nearly all soybeans are grown from genetically modified seeds now.|p
Organic farming.|0
That IPM is aimed at minimizing or optimizing the use of high risk pesticides; IPM is not organic farming.|0
Example: kashi cereal since day one has claimed to be organic (GMO free and pesticide free) and they advertised that they were.|0
Well as it turns out that is the exact opposite of the truth yet at Walmart it still is put under organic cereals.|n
Understanding the 'USDA Organic' Label Those 275,000 comments and several reports are available publicly.|0
Go to their website and search National Organic Program.|0
Based on this overwhelming public opposition, this proposal prohibits its use in the production of all organic foods even though there is no current scientific evidence that use of excluded methods presents unacceptable risks to the environment or human health.|n
While these methods have been approved for use in general agricultural production and may offer certain benefits for the environment and human health, consumers have made clear their strong opposition to their use in organically grown food.|0
Since the use of excluded methods in the production of organic foods runs counter to consumer expectations, foods produced with these methods will not be permitted to carry the organic label.|0
Organic farming does not have anything to do with, nor does it oppose GMOs.|0
However, the idea behind organic farming is based on a more natural way to produce our foods and this does not fit the idea of GMOs.|p
Now since business is all about supply and demand, before people knew about the benefits of organic foods, people only cared about shape, size, color, and price.|n
Now since organic foods are one hundred percent natural, they will lose out to genetically enhanced foods based on the above-mentioned factors every time.|n
At this point of time, organic foods were definitely not sustainable if they were your only business.|n
As of recent times, with the prices of organic foods going through the roof, this is a very sustainable business and a profitable one too.|p
A lot of farmers now adopt new and ingenious methods of producing organic fruits and vegetables.|0
One such method is called aquaculture, where organic fruits and vegetables are grown in a growing medium and feed off the waste produced from a fishpond.|0
This is one of the best examples of sustainable organic farming.|0
Some of the common products are an organic salt, organic sugar, and even organic “daals”.|0
Some of the more popular online stores for organic foods in India are natures basket, localbanya, baazarcart, and lalaji24x7.|0
However, if organic farming can sustain the current and projected world populations is currently being analyzed.|0
I am of the belief that organic farming is the way to go, with one caveat.|p
"According to the definition of ""organic farming"" given by the European Commission's Agriculture and Rural Development department, one of the criteria of organic farming is the ""absolute prohibition of the use of genetically modified organisms."""|0
Reference: What is organic farming?|0
Culinary bulk and retail herbs - certified organic with distribution to major players in the industry.|0
I can only assume they use local, organic, and sustainable when financially convenient, but that certainly GMO foods are also sourced.|0
'Organic' is a method of farming with out synthetic chemicals, hormones and additives.|0
Although there have been organic foods for some time, in the US, the USDA certified organic program was started in 2002.|0
There are also government subsidies available for organic food production, but not at the same level commodity producers receive funding.|0
India also has the potential , but India is against GMO, and its struggling to bring back its traditional agricultural cultivation methods, which is organic.|p
"Is there a basic definition of ""organic vegetables""?"|0
"Because food is so basic, just as basic as water, and shelter, each person is allowed to have their own personal definition of ""organic""."|0
However, for the sake of conducting commerce, each nation has it is own legal definition.|0
Organic farmers did not.|0
If Monsanto employees were offered an organic fruit on one plate, and a GMO fruit on another plate, which one would they pick for their children?|0
Just to add on a bit: First we should make a distinction between organically grown tea and organically certified tea.|0
Not all organically grown teas are organically certified and fewer still may be organically certified in your market.|0
Generally, it is easier to start a new organic farm then to certify an existing one.|p
You can probably start a new farm outside the 'core producing area' or 'zhengyan' area of Wuyishan or halfway down the mountain from Wudongshan and get organically certified but of course the drop in quality is expected.|0
The cost of getting organically certified is almost US$2k.|0
Additionally, if you want the USDA Organic seal on your product you will need to go through an organic certification agent.|0
"In much of the coffee-growing world, ""organic"" is more about labeling then the reality of how the coffee is produced."|0
There are huge, mega-farms in places like Brazil where the coffee friends look like any other monoculture from the air and the shrubs are treated like soybeans--spray for this, spray for that, fertilize the entire field at one time, etc.|n
however, in places like Ethiopia, most small farmers simply cannot afford the luxurious of commercial fertilizers and pesticides.|n
These farmers then sell the relatively small amount of product that comes from their small farm to a larger cooperative and all the beans from all the local farmers are mixed together to make a really big batch that might be of interest to a big coffee buyer.|p
"By definition, their coffee is ""organic,"" but in as much as these farmers cannot afford the certification fees for having their farm deemed ""organic,"" the coffee will not be labeled with the recognized ""organic"" label."|p
"Having explained that ""organic"" is really a marketing label rather than a ""real"" thing in much of the coffee world, the other reality is that there is no difference in taste between a certified organic coffee and one that is not--IF they are the same coffee varietal, grown in the same region, grown at the same altitude, and picked when properly ripened, processed in the same manner after picking, packed and shipped appropriately, roasted by a master roaster, ground fresh before preparation, and served to you hot in a clean cup."|p
In my opinion, the organic label becomes questionable in these circumstances.|n
So in order to answer you correctly about organic fresh produces worth buying, we need to consider were you live and what time of the year you are.|0
So sure I recommend people around me to buy organic only . |p
Now we demand our markets to have most and same fresh produces all year long and looking spotless, just like it could be compared to industrialized items... Like that, the label 'organic' often becomes unfit.|n
Agriculture is full of surprises and very often, if produces are treated organically, rarely every year is the same.|0
Fruits and vegetables with 4 numbers on the sticker means they were conventionally grown, and 5 numbers beginning with a 9 means they were organically grown.|0
In the UK and EU labelling laws prohibit the use of the term “organic” as an arbitrary marketing term, and it is reserved only for certified produce.|p
"Aha, here we go: Put simply, if you see the ""USDA Organic"" or ""Certified Organic"" seal on your food, the item must have an ingredients list and the contents should be 95% or more certified organic, meaning free of synthetic additives like pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and dyes, and must not be processed using industrial solvents."|p
For potentially toxic materials that is a deceptive amount of wiggle room.|0
However, USDA organic does mean something, and in the case of a crop, such as a tomato, it will have to be 100% organic.|p
Eg: non-organic blueberry concentrate could contain quite a lot of pesticides and still be marked organic, since it is only a few % by weight in the product.|n
That could be labelled as an organic processed food under USDA or EU regs… but not be nearly as organic as the customer might assume.|n
"While ""buy local, know your farmer"" and farmer's markets are exploding and are trends, not all farmers at farmer's markets are organic and many use GMO seeds and apply pesticides to their crops."|0
Today big companies want to get in the organic business because we are demanding it but are also trying to dilute organic standards.|n
When it comes to preparing for organic farming, in the U.S. at least, it is best to start with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.|0
there is a great deal involved in being certified, and one MUST be certified before one can claim that their product is organic.|0
Relying on labels instead of watching a company’s practices is a horrible method for consumers.|n
It’s really just marketing.|0
For the same species of plant, organic and conventional products have the same nutritional value and flavor.|0
The only direct benefit to the consumer of organic is avoiding pesticides.|p
Organic agriculture might be better for the planet, though.|p
For animal products, the difference in flavor based on what the beast ate would certainly overwhelm any organic/non-organic flavor difference, even if there is one, which I doubt.|0
So if you want to eat organic, you will have to trust your food vendor, your restaurants, and your restaurant's food vendor.|0
"The problem with store bought veggies is that the regulations for ""organic"" do not have the same USDA ""definition"" as our common usages, and that folks (or ""regulators"") are not always honest when Profit is involved."|0
"Witness the flap a few months ago about the supposedly ""organic"" milk sold by Safeway and Kroger stores under the ""O organics"" house label which a organic advocacy group, bought, tested, and found it to be conventional milk which was ""relabeled""."|0
"Yes, that ""organic"" milk met USDA standards, but those ""standards"" are VERY different from Our understanding of the meaning of the word."|0
"Those ""standards"" specificaly allow the unrestricted use of antibiotics, and many other supplements (among other things)."|0
"Thus, as with the terms ""natural"", and ""cage free""; the term ""organic"" is being ""conveniently"" ""redefined"" by our ""regulators"" to allow multinational and national corporations to do whatever they damn well please in the name of ""protecting"" corporate profit at all costs."|0
"Bottom line: If you did not produce it, or personally know the people who did, it may not be what We define as ""organic"" (no chemicals, no pesticides, no antibiotics, and grown using sustainable methods)."|0
satvikorganic .com/ They have a good variety of organic products.|p
I am not really sure how you can verify if it is truly organic though; you could always ask the people there.|0
They seem to be genuinely organic if you want to try... Or you could do as I try to do - grow your own veggies on the terrace (Or at least some herbs and greens).|0
"What ""Organic"" certification can you get?"|0
You may wish to take a look at the formal organic marking trade: Industry Statistics and Projected Growth|0
It is a divine place which sells organic products, has a detox cafe and an organic restaurant.|0
To know if processed and manufactured products are truly organic, you can just check the certification mark but fruits and vegetables are a little harder so buying them from recognized organic outlets would be advisable.|0
Assuming you mean Organic Food, then this is best thought of as a brand name.|p
Technically, the label Organic means that the Soil Association has provided the manufacturer with a certificate stating that the food has been produced according to certain, rather arbitrary, criteria.|0
These criteria include - Crop rotation - No genetic modification - No antibiotics or wormers - No cloned animals - No battery farming These criteria do not include - The size of the farm - The length of the journey from producer to shelf - No pesticides - Free range So, a product labelled organic might have been exposed to pesticides on an enormous farm on the other side of the planet - and a product from your local farm shop might not be eligible for the Organic label on a technicality.|0
The 'organic' label is abused as much as the concept of 'grass-fed' and 'free-range.'|n
"The marketing term ""organic"" does not actually mean anything so there is no way to answer your question in that context."|0
How can I trust the claim that it is organic , and spend extra for it ?|0
Dont buy from big basket they tell its organic but it is not.|n
Organic in this context is a marketing term.|n
It means that food is produced according to the arbitrary standards set by a marketing lobby.|n
There is no nutritional advantage to buying organic.|n
There has only been one really good study comparing organic and other farming directly with appropriate controls, and it was only done on strawberries.|0
The study showed that the soil was much healthier and supported many more species in the organic case.|p
In the US, organic farming can use pesticides, so long as they are natural.|0
Someone mentioned container gardening and I thought I should expand on that.|0
First, you will want to make sure your patio gets enough sunlight for the veggies you pick.|0
Secondly, Get sturdy containers that have drainage wholes on the bottom and also buy either a plastic container for the bottom if the container does not already come with it (you do not want to hurt your deck by putting it straight on there) Third step.|0
"buy ORGANIC gardening soil (NOT top soil) or if you have soil around that you can use mix it with some organic compost ( How To Compost | Organic Composting 101 ) to give it enough nutrients to kick start your plants :) Not sure your soil is good?"|0
Here Are 66 Things You Can Can Grow At Home In Containers When it comes to watering, it will depend how much rain water you get a week.|0
Typically you want to water them with at least 1 inch a week (which can be difficult to determine at first).|0
Is organic not 'better' in terms of our management of the earth resources?|p
When organic farmers want to prevent weeds from growing in their fields and beds, they have three different options: herbicides (weedkillers), mulches, and cultivators.|p
Organic herbicides commonly used are oil-based herbicide, soap-based herbicide, and acetic acid.|0
They are applied with Backpack Sprayers (used for fruits and vegetables) Crop Sprayers (used for commodity crops) Mulches don’t kill weeds.|0
They cover the soil surrounding crops, preventing weeds from germinating and growing.|0
This method doesn’t prevent all weeds from growing, however, so plan to pick weeds from time to time.|0
Mulches include Paper Mulches Plastic Mulches (some which are biodegradable) Cultivators mechanically remove weeds from the soil, sometimes through cultivation.|p
A few examples are Garden Hoes Garden Tillers Crop Cultivators (used for row crops) Although all of these methods are considered “organic,” the most natural weedkiller is pulling weeds yourself.|p
What type of farming equipment?|0
Why would that preferentially benefit from organic food?|0
Chipotle does not sell organic, I do not believe, although they do market themselves as having healthy/good ingredients.|n
If it is done properly, organic vastly out yields conventional agriculture.|p
Here is just one example of many: India's rice revolution All while improving the environment: The System of Rice Intensification (SRI)… . is climate-smart rice production But do it improperly and organic can yield far less and even be more harmful to the environment.|p
Here is just one example of many: India's rice revolution All while improving the environment: The System of Rice Intensification (SRI)… . is climate-smart rice production But do it improperly and organic can yield far less and even be more harmful to the environment.|n
"The main ""organic fertilizers"" are, in ranked order, peat, animal wastes, plant wastes from agriculture, and sewage sludge Animal sources include the products of the slaughter of animals."|0
Bloodmeal, bone meal, hides, hoofs, and horns are typical components.|0
Organic fertilizer usually contain fewer nutrients, but offer other advantages as well as appealing to environmentally friendly users.|p
So to be green, it is probably ideal to eat organic food in the UK... but it also means you have to be on board with animal meat production/consumption as well.|0
Because we are organic our food production has a large negative carbon footprint, no grain is ever used, and our livestock are moved with horse's the old way, the cabon free way.|p
Except organic techniques are not necessarily better for the environment.|n
Standards vary worldwide; however, organic farming in general, features practices that strive to foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.|p
In general, organic foods are also usually not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents or synthetic food additives.|0
Organic growing is about the quality of soil.|p
Organic growing is based on the idea that biological methods are tried-and-tested, more effective, and sustainable.|p
The answer: it depends on how you ask the question, but studies suggest that organic farming is at least 90% as productive as conventional farming, and possibly higher.|p
Even organic farming as practiced today is highly mechanized, and even if it required three times as many people as it does today it would still use only a tiny fraction of the population.|0
"Most ""organic"" farming these days is practiced in the same kind of monoculture that conventional farming is, rendering it prone to the same kind of peril where everybody gets lots to eat today, at least until the wrong pest arises and then everybody starves to death simultaneously."|n
The advantages in organic animal farming are much more pronounced than organic vegetable farming, which may do a better job of preserving soil and reducing oil consumption, making it capable of supporting more people in the long term, but indistinguishable today.|p
The big unknown is whether we will be able to do so in the future, and the whole point of organic agriculture is that conventional farming is unsustainable and will not be able to feed this many people in the future.|0
it is more sustainable than conventional farming.|p
It uses less fuel, produces less waste, does less damage to the soil, and introduces fewer long-lived pesticides into the environment.|p
Buying organic is a demonstration of support for a philosophy of farming and caring for the earth, the water, the animals that give us food.|0
On the local level, it supports sustainable farming practices.|p
Organic farms do not respond to the presence of insects by polluting the environment with poisons.|p
Many people believe that organic foods are safer to eat than conventionally or factory farmed food.|p
Whether buying organic is worth it or not depends on one's priorities.|p
Organic apples are absolutely NOT “healthier”, whatever that means.|n
They’re just apples, just like regular apples, except a lot more expensive.|n
“Organic” is a marketing term, and organic fruits and vegetables are grown with large amounts of pesticides, fungicides, and other “chemicals”.|n
It’s just that these are “organic approved” chemicals, which means they’re pretty much the same as any other chemicals, or else they wouldn’t be used.|n
And they’re more expensive.|n
Organic chemistry did not bother renaming itself to something like carbon chemistry because everyone understood what it meant.|0
Organic milk is milk from livestock who have been bred and brought up under the standards of organic farming.|0
For instance, an organic farm can not use synthetic pesticides or drugs like hormones and steroids.|0
"Organic milk will have a label showing ""Certified Organic"", although it may be certified by any number of different entities."|0
"The most common is ""USDA Certified Organic""."|p
Organic foods in general go through a much more rigorous certification than non-organic foods do.|p
do not get me wrong, do your research, there are many products that claim to be organic but are not wholly organic, but it is worth the effort to know the difference.|0
Keep in mind that GOTS certification ensures organic fiber is used and that the processing of that fiber is done environmentally and socially thoughtfully.|p
There is no nutritional advantage to organic food.|0
The term is 100% marketing hype.|n
People who insist on organic have typically been frightened into it, or are being fooled by an orthorexic halo effect into thinking it’s somehow magically “better”.|0
Another uniqueness of this food is It is ORGANIC FOOD by default Because no body cultivate commercially this food item.|n
So it is organic food by default.|p
I do own an organic cotton fabric company that supplies manufacturers... HarmonyArt - organic design fabrics and we are GOTS certified too.|p
I am an avid label reader, and prefer minimally processed, local, and organic (and humane, as Rich Canino mentioned).|p
I never seek organic because there is no reason to.|n
it is just a marketing gimmick.|n
If it has the USDA Organic Certification on the label it should be organic.|p
I know that opinions are split on the organic/non-organic foods.|0
I know that there are fake organic products out there.|n
The EWG (Environmental Working Group) each year puts out a list of the top fruits and vegetables that you should buy organically if at all possible (a.k.a.|p
Generally there is precious little, if any, evidence for health benefits associated with either organic or locally sourced food.|n
In fact, I avoid organic on principle because it is largely a scam.|n
A carrot is a carrot when it comes from the same farm or a similar local, organic farm.|n
Coffee with an organic label must be roasted on a roaster dedicated to organic green beans, or on equipment that has been thoroughly cleaned between roasts.|0
Even if the beans are certified organic, they can’t be labeled as such once they go into a roaster that has been used for non-certified beans.|n
For this reason, most small batch roasters either sell all organic coffees, or none at all.|0
And sometimes, for marketing reasons, we’ve seen roasted bean labeling highlighting organic beans, even though the equipment renders the roast non-organic.|0
Fact and Fiction: What is Organic Coffee?|0
When you buy organic produce and meat what do you look for on the package?|0
At a fundamental level, organic products will refer to food cultivated, harvested, stored, processed, packaged or traded without the use of any external chemical, biological or genetic intrusion.|p
In my experience, USDA has a fairly comprehensive set and can be a good starting point - Agricultural Marketing Service - National Organic Program|0
I have a phd in Agricultute and Biology- I actively try to buy non-organic foods as a) there are no benefits or taste differences, b) I realize organics are a marketing differentiated business (albeit a big business) and c) it is not more sustainable.|n
It says organic, but is that something to rely on?|n
"According to Wikipedia: "" Organic foods are foods that are produced using methods that do not involve modern synthetic inputs such as synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers."|0
"[1]"" <URL>"" In the U.S. you might see labels certifying foods as organic."|0
When you see a food labeled as organic in the US, then it is a legal construct.|p
"There are typically laws (certainly in the United States) that define when you can label a food ""organic""."|0
USDA Certified Organic stamp, Non-GMO label, no antibiotic included/grass feed...For fruits/veggie, grocery stores usually have the organic section pointed out and you can see all the produce there have the same 9xxx series code.|0
Some food products are spuriously labelled, 'organic' which is according to someone's opinion could be just home-grown in a kitchen garden or by someone who does not use pesticides on the actual food itself but use pesticides directly or indirectly in the garden or that their neighbours do.|n
Yes, organic produce do taste better.|p
There is absolutely no way to tell an organic vegetable from a non-organic vegetable unless they are labeled.|0
Single-ingredient foods (like apples) have to be organic to get the organic certification.|0
However, this does not apply to multi-ingredient foods, which only have to be 95% organic to get the label.|0
Even a 99% organic food can only get the standard organic label.|0
There is, however, a 100% organic seal that multi-ingredient foods can earn if, in fact, they are 100% organic.|0
"Additionally, there is a seal that says ""Made with organic ingredients."""|0
Yes, as Tiangyi SI says, any high end supermarket in a major city will have vegetables labelled as organic.|0
There is definitely an organic foods movement in China, although I do not think it is yet a major cultural force.|0
"First, I hate labels and Organic is losing its appeal to me especially when I can read that so many ""things"" are allowed in the Organic process."|n
That said, there are some real benefits of Organic and they can be seen in: Organic Dairy Organic Chicken and Eggs I just think they taste better.|p
I get eggs mostly from my sister's farm and they are so unbelievably tasty that it is really sad that most people have forgotten what natural food tastes like; so when I cannot have hers, I buy the organic and they do taste better than the factory-farm stuff.|p
Organic is mostly more natural than other options.|p
"But with things that have a thick peal (like Bananas or Avocados), I fail to see the appeal because any ""chemicals"" typically do not make it past the thick skin."|0

Especially in metro cities, there are already who have established many organic stores who are also into organic agriculture.|p
People are showing lots of interest in Organic agro products because too much use of chemicals in farming sector.|p
I never venture into organic produce department unless there is no regular produce available (if there was a run on strawberries, for example, and there are no regularly grown berries left).|n
Firstly, companies do pay fees for product space, but they pay it to the distribution company for space in the warehouse, and the distribution company is often the same company that owns the stores.|n
Finally, Bob's had the distinction of being one of the few specialty baking good company, with many gluten-free, organic, and unusual products.|p
This allows them to convince stores to create a specialty baking section (generally only a four foot wide set of shelves) that is almost entirely their products because they do not have much competition.|p

Whole Foods, Chipotle... Maybe companies that sell farming equipment, non-gmo seeds.|0
Misinformation and lobbyists, the lobbyists for organic corporations are paying boatloads of money to fuel the trend and produce the misinformation.|n
Let me reply to the questions as follows: - There is a perception that people are starting to make their own organic products at home, but from experience, I find that they are merely makeing the selfie version of home-medication - who never tried to appease a sore throat with honey and lime?|n
When home production takes care of small quantities, the pursuit of the largest margin possible will force the big-company to take shortcuts, thereby targetting low-quality ingredients, which veers away from organic principles that is it.|p

Empirically, there is no evidence that suggests organic foods are any healthier than other foods.|n

We were just raising cattle like they have been for hundreds of years prior.|p
If the customer was not there when the butcher came to slaughter their animal, we took a polaroid showing the dead animal with their mark.|0
The reason I shared this is because, that was the bulk of our advertising.|0

According to the standards set for organic milk, I doubt any of the companies, or at least the majority of them can work to meet them.|0
Organic milk means that the milk comes from cows that are reared without any growth hormones that are artificially made.|0
Another thing worth taking note of is the fact that for the milk to be organic, it has to be milked and drank instantly, without any preservatives or anything of that sort.|0
Source: Does Organic Milk Really Worth Going The Extra Mile?|0
Organic farming, on the other hand, does not use any chemical fertilizers or pesticides, neither does it cross breed or genetically enhance any species.|p
All feed, fertilizers, pesticides and techniques are one hundred percent natural and hence referred to as “organic”.|p
If I were to guess what’s good for my body between something natural and something altered by man, I would go for the natural product every time.|p

that is as absurd as being sure that a taste difference IS because of being organic, without testing.|n
The organic I have tried tastes exactly the same.|n
Hi Craig, I am not an Organic-food enthusiast, and I share your thoughts about them.|n
But, objectively speaking, I have definitely felt a difference in the flavour and taste of strawberries that I get at the Organic supermarket compared to the non-organic ones.|p
Since my parents have farming business I can feel the difference in appearance and taste of the organic grown vegetables, fruits and grain.|p

But in general it is easier to find a small-scale organic producer which picks the fruit ripe than it is a non-organic producer.|0
If you find that the fruit you are getting from an organic grower is not as sweet as you like, look for someone who grows at a smaller scale and is more likely to pick the fruit riper.|p
From my experience, organic fruits are sweeter and have a richer, fuller flavour|p
There are several naturally derived pesticides permitted for organic food production such as pyrethrum (derived from flowers) Although produced from natural materials these pesticides are still not totally risk free and they may also affect the taste of the food.|n
So yes, you must wash all food, organic or otherwise not only because of pesticides but as Jeremy Miles points out because of the other factors involved in food production.|0
I find normal ginger tasteless but organic ginger has good taste.|p
VERY much agree on the taste difference!|0
I will add that organic chicken is much more delicious.|p
Recently, after being on an organic diet for about 6 months, I have noticed similar taste differences in other foods such as apple, bananas, egg, etc.|p
However, there is a remote possibility that organic food is rich in nutrients which makes them delicious.|p
Organic plants are the same plants as non organic.|0
Fresher coffee beans will taste better.|p
A more experienced roaster will be able to express flavor better...like a good chef.|p

My friends and I could tell the difference between the organic and the conventional reliably.|0
It sure tastes better!|p

I have been following your answers in the Organic Food section for a while now, and if you are claiming organic food is not at all superior to conventional, and even in some cases is WORSE for you, why does organic food simply taste better then?|p
Yes Organic food taste is better.|p
By the organic food we can make different dishes in different flavor and its good for health.|p
They might be higher in anti-oxidants than inorganic, but taste largely depends on where they were grown, where and when they were harvested, and how long it took them to get to you.|0
Yuki makes a very good point that taste is subjective and affected not only by the actual chemical makeup of the food, but by expectation and perception.|0
If you think something will taste better because it is organic, it probably will!|0
There are certain vegetables which has a good nutrient quality which are as follows: 1.|p
Organic Cabbage is very rich in fibre, the main health benefit of roughage.|p
The layered and levelled testing methods of quality ensure that there are no signs of pesticides and other chemicals found in the organic cabbage.|p
The organic tomatoes are loaded with nutrients that are vital for the growth.|p

In which case, it is natural, and better for you on all levels.|p
The taste of organic fruits and vegetables s the most natural thing you can taste.|p
I cannot tell The difference between an organic apple and a conventionally grown one.|0
Higher brix means better quality [3].|p
I can personally attest to enjoying the flavors from my organically grown food (apples, beans, blueberries, carrots, cherries, ginkgo nuts, gooseberries, herbs, honey, leeks, lettuces, mushrooms, onion, potatoes, raspberries, squashes, strawberries, tomatoes, walnuts) more than non-organically grown food I have purchased.|p

Ref: 'You Are Not So Smart': Why We cannot Tell Good Wine From Bad In short: There is no evidence that organic food tastes better than non-organic ones.|n
"As far as I can tell, organic eggs may taste better than ""industrially-produced"" eggs, but in my experience and to my taste, NOT better than any unspecified free-range or non-factory eggs."|n
I think that organic food does have more flavor.|p
"It tastes more like the authentic fruit or vegetable should taste, instead of a ""watered-down"" version."|p
In my opinion, organically grown food taste better if grown locally because it is fresher and full of nutrients.|p
I know that at least organic eggs do indeed taste better.|p
"Plus, the yolk has a more attractive color (not the highlighter-yellow of ""manufactured"" eggs but a rich, deep, golden color)."|p
On the other hand, compare organic lettuce from Walmart to the normal stuff in target and you will not find much of a difference.|0

Yeah, And honestly, bananas are one fruit where organic just always does taste better.|p
But that is not a thing that makes organic fruit taste better than non-organic fruit as it is possible to obtain the same result with both.|n
Maybe, but not because they’re organic.|0
Organic is a marketing term, and there is no nutritional advantage to organic food.|n
Coincidentally, though, some organic food is grown on boutique farms which produce prettier or higher quality products in exchange for bigger environmental impact.|0
So you might find an organic tomato tastier, but the “organic” part has nothing to do with it.|p
There is no taste difference, and there is no health difference.|n
"There is no advantage at all to ""organic"" food . "|n
The organic berry has greater flavour concentration.|p
Now if we take one cup of GMO berries and put that into a smoothie or one cup of organic berries, which smoothie will have more blueberry flavour?|p
If you want a better tasting product, you want to go organic.|p
I can tell this from experience that there is significant difference in taste between organic and and regular milk.|p
The texture and smell is also better for organic milk.|p
We started using organic milk few years ago and now if we have to get regular milk sometimes, the difference in taste is very noticeable.|p
Even our kids can tell the difference.|p
Sometimes, the improved taste of organic produce is because it is fertilized with manure.|p
Sometimes, it is because plants produce more phytotoxins in response to bug attack.|p
Sometimes, it is because modern fertilizers allow non-organic crops to grow so fast and big they do not have time to develop as much flavor, whereas organic produce matures slower in a nutrient-poor growing environment.|p
"Sometimes, it is because farmers grow and sort organic produce as a ""premium"" (high-margin) crop, with different growing/harvesting/shipping practices (like growing heirloom tomato varieties or leaving the fruit on the tree a bit longer)."|0
Healthy, tasty, nutritious.|p
Yes you are right as this organic products are pesticides and chemical free and are grown by the help of natural Fertilizers.|p
There are certain vegetables which has a good nutrient quality which are as follows: - See more at: Which organic vegetables you should buy?|p
If you are organic, commercial organic farmers do not use many pesticides, either.|p
Most of that material ends up back in the field as organic matter, however.|0
The statement that extra chemicals are used is *extremely* incorrect.|p
Look up how organic certification and standards work, and you will discover that this could not be further from the truth.|p
A lot of them go as far as saying that organic agriculture uses plant protection products equally or more toxic than those used in conventional agriculture, which is of course, absolutely ridiculous.|p
There is not rule to start a organic farming..What makes the difference is to use natural and non-chemicals.|p
You can make organic compost (like cow-dung, green compost)or garden compost for enriching the soil nutrients and can use neem cake or other natural pest and diseae control.|p
So what does it take to have an organic vegetable garden of your own?|0
Choose natural fertilizers The whole point of organic gardening is to use natural fertilizers.|p
You can either use well-rotted animal manure or get organic fertilizers from your nearby store.|p
With these simple steps you can easily build an organic garden of your own and have the best of fruits and vegetables in your house.|p
We could set up big farms in the rural prisons and grow organic food for all the prisons in the rural areas (which means almost all of them).|0
That would not only be a means to obtain healthy, genetic, pesticide and chemical free food, yet it can be an obtainable agricultural skill for the incarcerated, for agricultural work on the outside and a way to help introduce farming to dilapidated urban communities, which has already started by organizations such as the Occupy movement, Corporations and major food stores deliver the best products to the wealthy and middle class, and throw the leftovers to the inner-city neighborhood, who receive more junk food and high-fat, high-salt products.|p
Organic can still use pesticides and fungicides and food safety can be influenced by the farm.|0
For example, I am not certified organic because it does not allow some things to be used with animals.|0
I do not lie to people about it but equally do not qualify for organic.|0
I use organic seed and such in the garden and share the what, why I do what I do with customers especially.|0
There are some that perhaps might be organic but could do better in food safety practice or something else.|0
Kindly look into the methods used for insect and animal control used by organic farmers.|0
This idea that organic farmers employ other “organic” sprays is genuinely ridiculous.|n
Know how organic farmers control weeds?|0
Know how organic farmers control aphids?|0
Organic is about how the food is being cultivated, that they do not contain pesticides and non-GMO and you save all the harmful components ingesting them.|p
I am not sure you are aware of this, but lots of organic produce is made with pesticides and herbicides.|0

"""Organic"" and conventional farming rely heavily on the use of molecular compounts such as DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE (DHMO)!!!"|0
"""Organic"" growing forbids using any refined minerals, so you are eating potentially toxic impurities along with the minerals."|n
"But the ""organic"" lobby spends hundreds of millions of dollars to make you think it is a good thing to eat animal poop."|n
Just thinking about swallowing heaping spoonfuls of those above items makes my mouth water (animal blood... yummy, yummy, yummy).|n
Personally, I would rather eat food without toxic impurities and without animal blood and poop.|n
It comes from Organic Farming, which was a term first used by Oxford University agriculturalist Lord Northbourne, in his book Look to the Land in 1940's.|0
Northbourne touched upon the subject of fertilizers and chemicals being used on farms, calling the method as Chemical Farming and then comparing it with a bio-dynamic methodology or organic farming.|0
“In the long run, the results of attempting to substitute chemical farming for organic farming will very probably prove far more deleteriousthan has yet become clear.|0
When we refer to organic farming, are talking about green manure and compost, biological pest control?|0
Maybe I do not actually know what organic farming is.|0
Being organic does not mean they do not use pesticides.|n
Au contraire..pesticides are rampant in the organic market . |n
As per the definition of organic farming,it is the system of farming in which we exclude synthetic chemical fertilizers and include green manures compost and farming wastes by the definition itself we can conclude that irganic farming iclude those rhings which are already exist in our farm so it automatically reduces off farming wastes and reduce pollution|0
"""Organic"" just means there are no synthetic pesticides or fertilizers- and some synthetics were developed specifically because the organic variants were either ineffective or harmful."|n
"Take ""green manure""- it is the cause of multiple E. coli outbreaks in organic produce in recent years."|n
"Not only are pesticides allowed, but some of the ""organic"" pesticides are much more toxic than standard pesticides."|n
Organic farming uses plenty of pesticides.|n
Organic farming also uses fertilizers and pesticides.|n
In fact, organic farming uses pesticides that are actually more toxic than conventional pesticides, such as rotenone and pyrethrins.|n
On the other hand, it is quite a regular occurrence to find lab tests showing Glyphosate on organic food from blow-over or runoff from a neighbouring farm.|0
Yes organic farming is the future in India.|0
Organic farm products command a better price and using organic manure, increases productivity of farms.|p
Moreover organic farming is cheaper than using inorganic fertilizers.|p
I don’t think any farmer (conventional or organic) wants pollute the environment with poisons, but I wouldn’t assume all organic food is pesticide free.|n
Organic farms are permitted to use certain “organic” pesticides, e.g.|n
When organic food is tested for conventional pesticides the overall results are generally much lower than those for conventional produce (as they should be).|p
"it is a shame that organic food is not tested for permitted ""organic"" pesticides due to the extra expense involved."|n
Local, small scale farming requires less pesticide costs and lower transportation fees.|p
With the proper use of natural pesticides, organic food is harmless to human.|p
I meant that all vegetables of all kinds are in the end composed of organic chemicals.|n
I fully understand about the rigours of organic certification as the rest of my answers will testify|0
Like the chemicals used as part of organic farming?|n
I think any reputable and qualified nutritionist will tell you that there is really no difference.|n
So the chemicals will move towards the organic farm with the water from upstream farms.|n
Use of strong pesticides also cause migration of pests to the organic farm.|n
I have heard organic food products are expensive.|n
Organic foods are not sustainable.|n
Nowadays people has become more educated how our organic food is grown and produced.|p
People buy organic food is the belief that it contains more nutrientsThis is hard to study, because organic produce is actually quite diverse in this way, with a number of nutrients significantly affected by the quality of the soil, the growing conditions, and when the food is harvested, among other things.|0
Since organic products is more expensive than conventional kinds.|n
Well, I want organic fruits and vegetables and I live in Hyderabad.|0
Im trying to convince my family to switch to organic but I have no means to PROVE that the produce that is being passed off as organic is actually organic.|0
They keep telling me that it could be the same unorganic stuff sold at a higher price cz it is labelled as ORGANIC.|n
And I tell them that at least there is a chance that these actually are organic.|0
Do you have a way of actually convincing someone that you actually supply real organic produce.|n

Other than that, there is no health benefit to the consumer.|n
"Simply visit this site Impact Foods | Organic Superfoods | Organic Foods UK and you will get cheap organic superfoods."|p
Sourcing an entire menu of only organic ingredients would be difficult, perhaps not insurmountable, but it might limit the menu.|0
Organic food is more expensive, and food cost is a fast food restaurants biggest cost.|0
To achieve the standard profit margins for a fast food restaurant, an organic fast food restaurant would have to be around 25% more expensive.|n
Proponents of organic food would be happy to pay the extra, but people who are indifferent about organic food are likely to be put off.|0
In the UK organic food sales account for around 1% of all food sales.|0
So a starting point would be to assume that the market for an organic fast food restaurant is 100 times smaller than the fast food market.|0
Given the aforementioned limitations I cannot see an organic fast food restaurant do well.|0
An organic cafe, yes, certainly, but not a fast food restaurant.|0
I still think it is just a way to get food that costs more.|n
If I want really good food, I will go to a farm shop or farmers' market and not care whether or not it is organic.|0
Better than a supermarket - there are a couple of large buying clubs in Westchester where you can get thousands of organic and local products for a great price.|p
Less organic food is produced, so less of it is available, so the price is higher.|n
I actively avoid organic food.|0
it is more expensive, and I see no benefit.|n
If there is some small upside to avoiding a little bit of pesticide for health reasons, it is likely too small to notice given the massive number of chemicals that enter the body from car exhaust, lotions, off-gassing of polymers, plasticizers etc.|n
"The main thing to know is that there is no nutritional or health difference between ""organic"", GMO, and conventional foods."|n
"The only significant difference is that ""organic"" is, on average, about twice as expensive."|n

The true price of organic food is cheaper than the regular one.|p
However, we, the consumers, count only the “internal price”, which is the price we pay directly.|n
There is no way of knowing if a product is fully or partly organic, oe even a pretender.|0
that is the reason behind these not finding a market, besides the fact that these are pricey.|n
There is zero nutritional advantage to buying organic.|n
It’s just more expensive.|n
"If I could afford it I would probably buy all veggies and fruits organic buy for now I just avoid some fruits and veggies that cannot get organic or substitute them with something less toxic: <URL>"" Cheers ;-)"|n

If an organic product costs more to inventory (keep in mind that stores purchase on speculation, and they do not always buy precisely the amount they need to satisfy demand in a given week), then that same organic product also costs more to waste than the conventional one.|0
In some places the prices for organic products can be more than 200% of the non organic product prices.|n
Sorry, dear, but multiple studies (unfortunately for you, even ones sponsored by the big money in organics) have shown zero difference.|n
it is sad that you buy into the marketing scheme of a conglomerate just desperate to have you pay three times as much for the same product, but that is what you are doing.|n
I think that if I were a cannibal that ate organic, I would hunt at organic food stores.|0

There appears to me to be a tendency to steer clear of the subject of pesticide residues and only mention nutritional content, rather than engage with the topic and try to argue that organic food contains equal or more pesticide residues as conventional, as you seem to be saying.|n
I dont know what sort of messed up contry you live in where organic means extra chemicals are used but I imagine it’s a pretty crappy place to live in if consumers are getting shafted so blatantly like that.|p
