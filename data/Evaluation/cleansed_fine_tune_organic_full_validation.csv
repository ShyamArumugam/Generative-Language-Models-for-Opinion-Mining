it is actually not as extreme as me: Two studies covering decades of work both found the risk of food poisoning is the same for organics and conventional food.|0
No higher or lower.|0
Again, the terms have no meaning or impact on health . |0
But given that organics are more expensive and have no benefit (proven in the 2012 Stanford study), I see no reason to waste money on them.|0
In the end, you can eat whatever you like (most food poisoning is preventable when food is cooked well), and take anything that makes you feel healthier if you can afford to spend money on it.|0
Organic is not bad for you, it just is not good for you either.|0
Generally, however, ‘organic’ livestock are raised with a pretty sensible approach to antibiotics—that is, if the livestock are sick, the disease may be diagnosed and then treated with antibiotics.|p
There is no difference in quality or nutritional content between GMO, organic or commercial foods.|0
"The federal rules for ""organic"" allow all sorts of dubious behavior, while prohibiting the use of ""organic"" labels on foods that are actually better and more nutritious because they cannot comply with rules designed for vast agribusinesses."|n

it is still grown in vast monocultures, far away from where you live, in varieties designed to ship well and look like a Platonic ideal of the vegetable.|0
They are still subjected to pesticides and fertilizers.|0
The pesticides they are subjected to are less effective, so they need to use more rotation and other techniques to avoid predators.|n
This dumps less dangerous pesticides into the environment and may be safer for workers.|p
The meat will be slightly more flavorful.|p
It should be noticeable in milk, but organic milk is generally subjected to a different pasteurization process.|0

There are organisations that certify the practices on some farms, to show they produce food ‘organically’ so without the use of artificial fertilisers, pesticides and so on.|p
If the produce has such certification, it is genuine.|p
However, I’ve seen organic on bottled water, and other things that are patently not ‘organic’.|n
Most people who eat organic food do not see it as a craze, but as an action that contributes to a better and healthier environment.|p
Food grown and raised to be certified as organic has been grown without the use of pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilisers.|p
Growing food this way means fewer pesticides, herbicides and chemicals find their way into what we eat and into our soils and rivers, kill our bees, etc.|p
There is some (limited) evidence that organic food is more nutritious but it is certainly the case that eating organic helps the body eliminate potential toxins.|p
Most people would argue that organic food tastes better too.|p
So, the main reasons people seek out organic food are health, environmental concerns, a desire to support more sustainable forms of agriculture and taste.|p
Of course some are responding to fashion, but mostly, it is because they have thought about it.|0
There are some disadvantages to eating organic food.|n
A big one is the cost, which is high because growing and raising organic food requires expensive accreditation, can be more labour-intensive, have lower crop yields (albeit of superior produce) and usually have poorer access to food distribution networks, increasing freight charges.|n
Sometimes, and this is my opinion, just because it is organically accredited does not mean it is good for the environment - soy beans, for instance, require a lot of water.|n
Still, an organically grown soybean is going to be better for the environment than one that is grown using pesticides and herbicides.|p
You might be eating 'organic chicken' without realising that the only thing organic about how it is raised is the food it is given - it can still be reared indoors, in a shed, and be called 'organic'.|n
Sometimes too, organic methods are not the most efficient use of land.|n
We need to find a balance between giant monocultures and small-scale, inefficient farming methods if we are going to feed the world properly.|n
I think we should all be thinking about where our food comes from and how it is produced, and the hidden environmental and human costs of agricultural systems.|0

- Organic Partnership with Wildlife - Support for the Farming Community - Water and Organic Food Because organic farmers do not use the harmful chemicals within their farming, they are not polluting the ground and the water supply.|p
- Organic Partnership with Wildlife - Support for the Farming Community - Water and Organic Food Because organic farmers do not use the harmful chemicals within their farming, they are not polluting the ground and the water supply.|0
Also, organic producers used pesticides.|0
Often the higher price for organic food is because yield is reduced, increased labor inputs, organic fertilizer is more expensive than conventional, and people are willing to pay a premium for the organic certification at the store.|0
Not only are organic farms typically smaller than conventional ones, but they also, on average, take more time to produce crops because they refrain from using the chemicals and growth hormones used by conventional farmers.|0
Production-oriented government subsidies reduce the overall cost of crops|0
There are marketing scams, but organic agriculture is not a scam.|p
it is a conservative policy which prohibits the use of poisons, contaminants and synthetic chemicals, and testing rigorously for their presence.|p
In the food industry it is not unknown for batches to be sold as organic which are *not* organic.|n
Organic has certain specifications about animal conditions, worker's conditions and a couple other things that ensure a marginally more ethical foodstuff.|p
The organic rules were designed by large agribusinesses, imposing overhead requirements that small farmers find it hard to meet.|n
And conversely, they allow processes that the founders of the organic movement find abhorrent: overcrowding, monoculture, poor nutrition safety created by extreme isolation rather than by care for the animals.|n
And these processes are in fact subsidized, even for extremely wealthy agribusinesses, so that farmers wanting to practice more responsible farming (both for health and the environment) have their prices undercut by government support, as if the government were trying to drive the out of business.|n
that is a virtue of this thing called bio accumulation, and it is one of the contributing reasons organic produce is on the average more nutritious than the competitive goods offered on the shelf next to it.|p
They will often taste better too.|p
it is just good marketing.|n
there is also this whole dialogue about making an attempt at being responsible stewards of the earth, something Organics make a best effort at and evolve as research does.|p
At this point, we have not quite made a hard choice between organic and conventional methods.|0
By default, they are less aggressive to the environment in small farms in Africa simply because these farmers do not have the money to put the large quantities of fertiliser on their crops the Americans or Europeans do.|p
A meta study by UC Berkeley on the yields of organic agriculture vs. conventional agriculture found that the average difference across all the crops they looked at was around 19% (in favour of conventional), but also noted that a lot of the studies analysed were biased in favour of it and that certain practices, specifically multi-cropping and crop rotation, which happen to be common in most of African smallholder agriculture, can reduce the gap to less than 10%.|n
that is not that much, and given the potential increase we just found, the lower yield of organic farming does not actually make a huge difference.|n
However without this its difficult to know whether the local market produce is in fact organic or not.|0
- reduce your meat intake.|0
grass-fed beef et al is expensive.|n
I believe that the industrialisation of meat is a bad thing - and that meat should not be affordable and as available as it is.|n
We eat much more meat than is necessary as a result to our changing attitude to mass farming of meat.|0
- I have noticed a rise in local market produce that is 'near' organic.|0
For small volume producers, being certified organic is often expensive.|0
If something is certified organic we sort of take it at face value.|0
Organic and non-organic are indistinguishable in terms of risk, safety or health of the milk.|0
I think buying and eating ONLY organic food is sort of weird and uninformed, though I buy plenty of humane/organic stuff.|0
"Thing is, the system is not perfect: -Ironically, because becoming ""certified organic"" can be time-consuming and expensive, it can cause problems for small-scale farmers."|n
"-organic food is more expensive and labor intensive; if all available food was ""organic"", we would have more hungry people, so it does not make sense to support it exclusively -If a friend told me they ate only organic food, I would ask, ""What exactly does a business have to do to get certified as 'organic'?"""|n

It helps you to understand more about organic food: Is Organic Food Really Better and Worth the Higher Price?|0
I think you are very right about branding and organics labels somehow convince people that the animal they are eating must have lived on some idyllic farm.|n
It does not help that we never see what an industrialized farm looks like, and we are mostly stuck with childhood images of petting zoos and wide open spaces.|0
I am glad you posted that photo - I imagine most people have never seen a photo like that.|n
The reasons are aplenty, The amazing marketing or hype.|n
You do not get the feeling of everything crowded together.|p
Basically, great shopping experience in shortFeel good factor : Wholefoods cleverly greets you with, saplings, flower plants and beautiful fruits.|p
Amazing selection of breads, not seen that good collection in another supermarket be it Sprouts, or HEB here in TexasQuality, and selection of meat, way better than any other supermarket.|p
They also mention the source of meat, not sure if its a gimmick, but hey all of these too add to feel good factorSomeone already mentioned about huge selection of cheese from across Europe and available in all sizes.|p
Good for trying outFood served in Wholefoods is not part of piggyback market strategy but a genuine attempt.|p
Again what they serve here, multiple selection of fruits, salads and maybe 11 types of just olives.|p
Overdoes for diet and health obsessed individualsFinally, not sure if this is part of each and every Wholefoods store.|n
I became Wholefoods customer because of their Beer Bar.|p
What an amazing selection of beers, with an option to taste each one of them(thought it would be cheap of you, they have like 50+ ) before you buy a glass, bottle or whole Growler.|p
Not to forget an option to pick marinated meats from their meat section and get it grilled or cooked in their barIn all, if you visit Wholefoods with an intention of it being a grocery store, everything will feel expensive and over-priced.|p

Organic agriculture is not more sustainable than conventional agriculture.|n
In fact, organic food can contain higher levels of mycotoxins due to less effective fungal control.|n
Let me give the disclaimer that if money and accessibility were no issue, I would buy absolutely everything organic, fair-trade, and local.|p
I do agree with grains not being as critical in the spectrum of organic.|0
I always buy cage-free eggs, but not always organic eggs.|0
Food that is processed and thus has added crap ingredients anyway (packaged snack foods, breakfast cereals, frozen meals) I do not see the point of organic.|0
Stuff that IS important to me to buy organic: Meat, dairy, and most fruit and vegetables, especially produce where I eat the exposed part of the plant (leafy greens, berries.)|p
Even if it is not organic, I prefer the tomatoes my neighbor grew over the organic ones from Brazil at Whole Foods.|p
However, Whole foods is not the only place that carries organic produce.|0
There are much cheaper options like Sprouts, if your'e in Southern California, or even national chain stores such as Albertons, which carry a limited number of organic products.|0
However, the nature of the advantages are often misrepresented and misunderstood.|0
This is partly due to the regulations to do with making “health claims” on food packaging packaging and advertising.|n
This skews the argument in favour of unhealthy and unethical food producers.|n
Organic farming has its priorities, namely ecological responsibility and non-toxicity.|p
Organic farming does not employ poisonous synthetic chemicals in agriculture.|p
No preservatives.|p
*all* of these use selective toxicity as their primary mode of action.|p
It also prohibits the use of preservatives, so organic food is fresher.|p
In many cases the freshness is equivalent to being more nutritious.|p
However, plastic packaging is common.|0
It is assumed to be safe… but scientific investigation suggests otherwise.|n
If you’re one of those health conscious people who are concerned with everything that goes into your body, organic food is probably for you.|p
It is for this reason that organic meat is preferred by most people as the animals are allowed to live their natural lives open and free, unlike commercial projects where animals are cooped up in cages their entire lives and fattened on artificial hormones and chemicals.|p
Organic foods are generally considered healthier and quite popular, and easily available.|p
Some online stores that sell a variety of organic foods are bigbasket, lalaji24x7, and onekirana.|p
ABOUT ORGANIC FOOD I would say in short: There is more to the picture of health than what we can see and feel.|0
Keep in mind: Diet alone, even organic, accounts for a limited portion of what makes people healthy.|0
Even with the strictest organic rules, it will still very likely conduce to the same dramatic rates of avoidable death: cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc...There are far more important factors than {organic/not organic to} prioritize in the attempt to develop a healthy lifestyle.|0
In some countries like New Zealand, the word organic is not regulated, you can sell anything calling it organic, even if it is not what people expect it to be.|n
Many countries have different labels/norms/rules for organic, they differ quite a lot.|0
Food can be grown organically and still be sprayed with toxic but organic products.|n
Food can be grown organically and still be covered in bacteria and viruses from the feaces of animals used to fertilize the crops (which is why I believe cover crops / no till are far better).|n
Organic does not mean ideal, far from it, but it is generally a good step forward to eat less toxic food, I just wish it was more affordable.|n
Organic does not mean ideal, far from it, but it is generally a good step forward to eat less toxic food, I just wish it was more affordable.|p
If it were, we would probably pay less for supermarket food, less for organic food, and more for truly nutritive food.|n
Organic does not mean that optimal soil practices were used, like cover crop / no till, which leave the soil and its biological life minimally disturbed and require minimal fertilizer/pesticide use because the the soil is kept covered, and plants are left to decompose slowly on the surface which fertilizes.|n
Organic does not guarantee anything about the quality of the soil, the nutrients in them and (from a more environmental standpoint) the level and diversity of biological life in them.|n
All the factors favoring sustainability on the long run, support organic farming as the future of agriculture around the globe.|p
Let me quote from my previous answer Deekshith Pinto's answer to Can India afford organic farming?|p
Let us see them one by one:There is no questions about the environmental sustainability of organic farming.|n
The organic farming techniques have proven to be of far less harm to the environment and human health.|p
With current state of technology, yes, organic farming is comparatively costlier and gives less output.|n
Mind you, even these stats vary quite considerably depending on the scale, region, farming practices, etc., and sometimes it has been even demonstrated that organic farming can also be more profitable than inorganic.|0
However, given the current policy regime of subsidized chemical fertilizers and pesticides and the lack of awareness towards the nuanced techniques of organic farming, it does become less profitable.|0
However, what most of the land users (farmers) fail to recognize is the masking effect of the chemical fertilizers and pesticides on the continued degradation of their own land leading them towards a vicious circle where these chemicals degrades land productivity and the farmers apply even more chemicals to increase productivity.|n
Therefore, it is always beneficial for the farmers to turn to organic farming in the long run, though it might mean less profits in the present circumstance.|n
The small land holders who live on a season to season basis might find it difficult due to the economy of scales but the medium and large scale farmers must shift to organic farming for their ow interest as well as for the benefit of the society.|0
The difference is though that “better for the environment” is far less BS than “it’s healthier” - because in its actual sense “organic” does mean “better for the environment” while it doesn’t mean “healthier” in its actual sense.|p
It did mean “healthier” around 20 years ago, at least in Europe.|0
"""Organic"" farming and ""regular"" farming are also difficult to define."|0
But to provide my (biased) opinion, the answer is no.|n
Organic farming, by the certification definition, is restricted to the use of certain techniques.|0
A good example of why a discussion needs to consider all these points: organic yields and conventional yields do not differ per se . |0
But organic yields, when considering labour input, is always substantially less.|n
In brief there are three big requirements for chickens to be organic.|0
Organic feed for entire life - exception for first 2 days after hatching 3.|0
allowed in conventional or organic production.|0
There are number of website through which you can Shop online organic spices.|0
I am not sure which is the best organic shop in the country however I have always shopped organic fruits and vegetables from Organicgarden and I have always been satisfied wit h their quick service.|p
They are into organic industry since last 5 years.|p
This is a good question and depends on the US definition of Organic wine.|0
There are two types in the US.|0
Wine Made With Organic Grapes and 100% Organic wine(USDA Organic).|0
The first category is (As it is wording states) made from organic certified grapes but not made with organic principles in the cellar.|0
The main point of differentiation to consumers is that sulphur dioxide is allowed to be added, with a maximum of 100 Parts per Million.|0
Though i have to point out that there is no control of this limit at all with either the US government or producing country, in the case of imported wines.|0
So these wines can fluctuate easily well above 100 ppm.|0
The total Sulfite level in the finished wine has to be under 10 Parts per Million and no other Non Organic ingredients are allowed.|0
This category of wine has to under go USDA Lab analysis every vintage to prove it is what it claims.|0
Of course like all marketeers we think the best Organic wines are the ones we import and distribute through out the US.|p
Several comprehensive reviews support the view that there are no nutritional or health benefits from organic products.|0
I lay them out in this piece: Organic vs conventional food The summary: It must be reasonable to assume, that should there be a stable measurable difference in the nutritional content of organic food, other reviews would be able to arrive at that conclusion independently of each other.|p
Instead, we have four reviews on similar lines - finding no nutritional or health benefits of organic food.|n
Then we have one study stating a different conclusion, but at a closer look demonstrating very little differences for a few nutrients, likely at a level of no consequence for our health or nutrient intake.|0
The Chivas Regal Effect: the idea that if something is more expensive than a similar product offered at a lower price, it must be of better quality.|n
And Whole Foods places its stores in high density areas filled with rich white people, which helps….|n
It does not look like the grocery store in the poorer areas (or the Wal-Mart around the corner where the poorer people shop) so they are tapping into something there as well.|n
Natural, pesticide-free, not-natural-chemistry free, additive-free are called organic product.|0
More and more people are turning to natural organic food due to safety and healthy reasons, both for people and environment.|p
Growing numbers of consumers want foods made with fewer, more simple and natural ingredients and without genetically modified organisms and pesticides.|p
And If you are looking for organic seeds, Forage Complete is one of the famous brand for providing organic or non gmo alfalfa seed, corn, Timothy, Oats, Clover and many more.|p
We are also providing important information about seed grazing alfalfa seed, along with an extensive offering of organic and hybrid seed products.|p
There is a great myth that organic farms will not produce the same yields that conventional farms do.|p
As organic farms mature, particularly in Europe where there are many that have been going for decades, they are now starting to produce greater yields than conventional farms.|p
It makes sense that the more nutritious the soil, the better yields from the plants.|p
Also many biodynamic farms are working with their environment to enrich the soil to an even greater extent.|p
I would not personally buy them organic.|n
I do not buy organic bananas, I just think they taste different.|n
On a quasi-related sidenote, I have met some Peruvian organic banana farmers.|0
They put the growing bananas in porous clear plastic bags instead of spraying pesticides.|0
it is labor-intensive, but developing-nation agriculture always is.|0
Now, more than ever, I would buy organic milk.|p

The cost of organic food in supermarkets is outrageous.|n
My main concern would be questionable authenticity of organic!|n
Adding to this would be bugs, bacteria etc.|n
wash well before consuming.|n
I will take food-grade pesticide over e.coli any day of the week.|n
"Organic produce is sprayed with pesticides too, it is just ""organic"" pesticide meaning it was extracted from a plant (eg low-quality tobacco)."|n
That does not make it fundamentally safer.|n
Organic foods are food items produced using processes without synthetics such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides.|p
Organic farming for me is the farming practices acquired with the organic materials (nutrition and base planting materials) using the indigenous varieties of seeds and crops (found and prominent in your neighborhood) , with integrated pest and disease management using either natural predator or biological control without using any of the inorganic (insecticides and pesticides) or nutrition enrichment substrate (fertiliser).|0
Residue free substances cannot be called organic, which is misunderstood as organic.|0
Organic food: fully produced based only on organic (life based) nutrients including fertilizers and pesticides (if used).|0
Organic compounds: any chemical compounds that are found in living things.|0
Carbon mostly occurs only in living things, so most of the compounds that contain carbon are often called organic compounds.|0
Experts at Consumer Reports believe that organic is always the best choice because it is better for your health, the environment, and the people who grow our food.|p
For instance, eating one serving of green beans from the U.S. is 200 times riskier than eating a serving of U.S.-grown broccoli.|n
Natural and organic food is very important part of our life.|p
Otherwise, a simple answer would be: gmo, organic, or I do not know.|0
No, in fact it is sometimes quite the opposite (as you can see from the comments).|p
While organic beef and perhaps other meat/animal products (like milk and eggs) have been verified as having better micronutrient profiles and lower incidence of pathogenic microbes (discovered very recently), organic vegetables are not necessarily better than conventional and often have pesticides as well.|n
"The label of ""organic"" is a type of certification and many organic standards do not exclude pesticides or other chemicals."|n
Organic foods along with diet/lifestyle fads like gluten-free (for the non-celiac), paleo (pure psuedoscience), and non-GMO (ignorant fear-mongering) are more about business and instilling fear in the scientifically-illiterate consumer.|n
There is no nutritional advantage to organic anything.|n
And, besides, it’s not possible to call one food “healthier” than another.|0
There is no single axis metric for “healthy”.|0
Organic, though, is purely a marketing term.|n
you might tell the people a little more about rotating crops and all of the other measures that are taken as part of the fundamental principals of organic farming to prevent soil erosion and degradation, preserve and conserve the other natural resources like water and the air.|0
"Organic farming is so much more than just sustainable farming, because when you think about it anything can be considered ""sustainable"" for an undisclosed amount of time... organic farming is more than a struggle to maintain the status quo (sustain) it is by design a regenerative method of farming capable of remediating if not reversing damages that have already been done."|p
To add on to what Joshua Engel said, farmers charge more for organic produce partly because they paid the USDA a large fee to become certified as organic- this enables them to tack on the label organic, which is a major selling point, is it not?|0
Our customers always have a lot of trouble with understanding the differences around Certified Organic, Organic and Natural and with good reason.|0
We did a fairly comprehensive guide on this and before researching on the topic, we thought we knew pretty much all of the differences but we were proven wrong!|0
An excerpt for your purposes from our guide is as follows (from an Australian perspective): Difference Between Organic and Natural - Easy Guide - Nim-Véda Australia Blog It turns out that in Australia at least, Certified Organic refers to products that are Organic and have been declared as such by an appropriate government/independent body.|0
Companies that are manufacturing Certified Organic Products probably have CEOs that have lost all their hair by now.|n
Acquiring Organic Certification is not a small feat, it takes loads of time, lots of documentation, going back and forth a gazillion times and heaps of finance.|0
Organic is probably (don’t shoot me, I did say probably and even italicised it) exactly the same in terms of quality and processing as Certified Organic without the official badge of honour.|0
What stops some people from purchasing organic however is that there’s no official proof.|0
It’s because the manufacturers of Organic Products should have some sort of documentation stating that the products have had no chemical and unnatural processing going on before it got to your fingertips.|p
Basically organic products are based on trusting the manufacture within reason.|0
Though there’s no official certification, the document stating the above still means the manufacturer better be telling the truth or they’re likely to be in hot water if someone finds out otherwise.|0
Organic/Natural Based is often referred to as Organic by Default.|0

The fundamental principal of organic farming is to produce crops without using chemicals, GMO seeds, or otherwise compromising the yield of the crop so that it is as natural as possible.|0
Often, this means using manual labor and symbiotic methods for control of insects, weeds, and disease, and organic fertilizer rather than chemical products.|n
Using natural selection seeds/cultivars, and preventing cross-pollination with non organic crops to insure the harvest produce is not adulterated with non organic produce.|n
You need to start with natural, untreated seeds, too.|0

I’ve taught my kids that “organic” means “a buck more expensive.” ;-) (They’re 16 and 13, so they get it.)|0
"There is zero nutritional difference between ""organic"" and conventional foods."|n
it is a marketing term, used to jack up the price.|n
"Some ""organic"" fruit may be raised and harvested in a way that makes it prettier or arrive fresher, so there could possibly be a flavor advantage, but that has nothing to do with it being ""organic""."|n
