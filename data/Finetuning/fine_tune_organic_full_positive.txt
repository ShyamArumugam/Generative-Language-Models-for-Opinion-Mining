Organic farming is the only solution to get rid of these poisonous foods loaded with pesticides.
So organic farming is the best alternative in order to sustain the agriculture for future generations.
But the argument is, it can't satiate needs of this starved world.
Though the argument is valid,scientists proved that continuous organic farming over year,may pickup the yields on par with inorganic farming.
Organic food is grown without artificial chemicals and buying it is beneficial for two main reasons.
Number one is that you are not slowly poisoning yourself and the people you're serving (which if they are small children - are much more sensitive to these things and it's probably more likely to affect their development).
You're not deliberately putting toxins in their mouths that their body should not be exposed to for optimal health.
The second reason is that you are voting organic.
Every purchase is a vote for what should be on the market.
So, this is more of a question regarding whether or not you personally think it's worth it not to consume toxins and support better agriculture methods.
Buying good food should be seen as a priority not a luxury... it's an apple not a thousand dollar handbag.
I believe that organic farming methods are, without question, better for the environment, the soil, and the people (often poor) who harvest the crops.
The company which you can trust for Organic produce is 24 Mantra.
We are working with close to 25,000 farmers covering almost 150,,000 acres of agricultural land across 15 States.
The company today has 15 Processing facilities and over 200 products.
And it is not always a question of organic pesticides - most are.
The meat and seafood is good at Whole Foods as well.
Companies are in business to make money, not dispense goodness, so by their own standard, the best is Whole Foods with 36% overall gross profit percent versus 28% for others.
I dislike Whole Foods because it fosters the idea that healthy food costs too much.
My picks for best are Trader Joe and HEB (TX).
While, as already metioned, that eating organic products usually prevent or at least deminish your intake of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics etc.
Another good reason for eating organic foods is for ethical reasons.
Organic farming on the other hand, treats it's animals and treats nature with more consideration.
Nature does not get hit and damaged by the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilisers in the same way.
The animals are treated better considering feed, space to roam(often outside, they don't spend their whole life in cages without even seeing the sky), and companionship(by this I mean that the animals often stay with their mothers longer and live of her milk.
This has a lot of benifits regarding the creatures health).
With organic production, it is possible a similar effect could occur, though differing practices might limit the severity as well.
I buy (mostly) organic because I want to (1) increase animal welfare (there are stricter regulations for the treatment of the animals in the Danish equivalent of “organic”) and (2) to avoid spreading pesticides, certain types of fertilizers, overuse of antibiotics, etc.
The advertising and reasons I could gather that most people bought organic was because they thought it was better for them.
I would say that while this is not perfect, they are worth the extra price.
But that is based on a view where I am taking a more holistic approach.
Organic food is, more clearly, food grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers.
Approved natural pesticides can used and fertizers are usually sourced from plants and animals.
Organic food is actively planted and managed using methods adapted to the plant and the local environment.
A large majority of cows (in the US anyway) are fed corn at some point if not at all points of their life.
I've been shopping at WF for over 15 years for 2 essential reasons: 1) Taste: Fruits, for example, taste quite a bit better than the ones you'll find in other supermarkets.
I assume so, because the food tastes better there, it is marked as organic, and emphasis is put on high quality products from responsible farmers.
(or, at least, they have been very good at reinforcing this belief in me via their in-store marketing efforts) What's more, I also perceive that purchasing products from a big company like Whole Foods is potentially less risky from a health standpoint than going to a local farmer's market...
I assume that a big company has the means to conduct quality control, and will naturally protect itself against lawsuits by ensuring the safety of its products.
With over a 100 organic dishes, and customizable options to suit your taste, you can always be assured you are eating nothing but the best.
I eat an almost 100% organic food diet and I'm reasonably certain that I have benefited from it but I still can't give an unqualified yes to this question.

Fair trade is partly organic too by the way, as it bans certain nasty pesticides etc, just not as many, and also has high animal welfare standards.
Yes, yes, and more yes!
In addition to the wonderful points in the answer made by Michele Trainer , there has been increasing research over the past few years especially shedding light on the importance of eating organic.
Here is one example that examined many studies: Page on ncl.ac.uk “We carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods” Other research and a simple example is available in the book "Toxin Toxout" by Lourie & Smith, whose simple experiment demonstrated how much pesticide levels fell in children's bodies when eating solely organic, and how much they rose again when given conventional food.
When in doubt about organics, we simply need to ask ourselves: does it feel/seem right to eat food that has been naturally grown or chemically grown?
For me, the answer is simple and clear.
In fact organics have inspired me to grow some of my own food, as the differences in flavor alone are huge and so worth it!
And when we start thinking a little more globally, and consider the effects of eating organic on more than just ourselves, then we find that many more reasons to go organic.

Farming without pesticides is also better for nearby birds and small animals as well as people who live close to or work on farms.
Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts .
In addition, the animals are given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, both of which help to keep the animals healthy.
In most countries, organic crops contain no GMOs and organic meat comes from animals raised on organic, GMO-free feed.
The European Union funded study found that organic fruit and vegetables have up to 50% more antioxidants, which scientists believe can cut the risk of cancer and heart disease.
They have also more vitamins and minerals such as iron and zinc.
The taste of organic fruits and vegetables is often superior to any conventional produce.

For veggies you need min.
Other answers have very well explained why organic produce is costly in general.
But, most of the cultivable land in India is by default organic.
That means the cultivable land is not exposed to pesticides or fertilizers at all, like North eastern parts of India, where farmers don't have access to chemical solutions.
Moreover, Farmers have to pay nearly Rs.10,000 ($200) for a certification process in India and it may take upto 5 years to convert the soil for the full fledged organic crops production.
In short, organic farming uses bio fertilizers and costly methods for pest control like biological control agents.
If you buy organic food, you at least reduce the overall amount of chemicals in your blood.
So, this food is healthier.
Some people have decided not to be part of this mass experiment and rather buy organic foods.

Recent studies are backing up what many thought: organic foods do indeed have a healthier nutritional profile than their conventional counterparts.
And they’re also lower in pesticide residues.
Eating organic fruits and vegetables could increase your antioxidant intake by 20-40%.
Organic strawberries have more nutrients and antioxidants than their conventional counterparts.
Organic tomatoes are 50% higher in vitamin C content than conventional tomatoes.
There are natural plant based harmless to human being, alternatives for Chemical fertilizers and Chemical pesticides - using those one can still achieve the agricultural yields as that of Chemical farming.
Crop rotation Instead of using chemical weed-killers, organic farmers conduct sophisticated crop rotations to keep their soil healthy and prevent weed growth.
After harvesting a crop, an organic farmer may use that area to grow "cover crops," which add nitrogen to the soil to benefit succeeding crops.
Organic/Natural Farming is sustainable provided some patience and efforts are taken to understand our soil, climate, plants and how the ecosystem works.
This helps the farmer take preventive steps to protect the main crop/s.
Organic farms tend to have many life forms in birds, insects, rodents, snakes etc.
The food pyramid is in full flow and most of the "bad" insects are the primary food.

Extracted Information from link: Nutrient Levels in Organic Foods Until recently, the primary value of organic foods resided in just a few factors: 1) Lack of certain undesirable constituents, mainly pesticides, herbicides, petroleum-based fertilizers and genetically-modified organisms 2) Reduction in environmental degradation by not adding toxins to air, water and soil 3) Support of healthier, pesticide-free environments for farm workers However, organic gardeners and farmers have always suspected an added value of organically grown foods – higher levels of nutrients.
Organic foods were found to be clearly higher in antioxidants, vitamin C, nitrates and some polyphenols; and moderately higher in protein.
Plant-based organic foods were consistently and clearly more nutrient dense, while animal-based organic foods were not consistently superior.
In three-fourths of the cases, polyphenols and antioxidants were greater in organic than conventional foods.
There are many reasons for these differences, and some of the details are interesting from a nutritional therapy perspective (Benbrook et al., 2008).
No, There are real benefits of organic food for people and the environment.
It is important to do your homework when choosing what to buy.
I like the trend towards sustainable agriculture.
100% I don’t want to let on that organic food is bad or any worse than conventionally farmed food.
The only legitimate illness prevention that organic offers (and more specifically, it’s only there in the sense that it is an explicit requirement of organic meats) is that livestock feed cannot contain any animal byproducts, which thereby reduces the risk of Mad Cow disease… there’s really nothing else you can explicitly tie to organic food.
There is some degree of correlation between organic and lower incidence of cruel treatment of livestock.
From life, we can find that organic food is becoming more and more popular.

Their prepared foods section is typically much larger than that of competitors It typically has more choices of prepared foods Its options are typically healthier Whole Foods also carries vitamins & personal care products that some believe are healthier for you.
Whole Foods is squarely focused on its target market: people who care about health & believe certain types of harder-to-find foods are better for health people who want prepared foods people who want vitamins & personal care products they perceive as healthier people who are willing to pay more for the convenience of finding all of the above in one place
I actually think of 'natural foods' as being organic, minimally processed and without additives.
That said, I love Whole Foods and their effort to carry, provide and guide the market toward more healthful and natural choices.
I have a whole foods that is the closest grocery to me Sometimes they have meat cuts or seafood that I typically don't see at publix or Kroger.
They also have a good beer and cheese selection and interesting International foods too.
However, there is one thing I love at whole foods, and that's the hot bar.
Whole foods's hot bar has items I like, and enough variety that I can change up from the usual greasy fried junk (some shift mates frequently eat chick fil a or zaxbys 3 times a week).
Yeah, it's pricy, but I like the change, and it can help me maintain healthy eating habits in an environment not so conducive to good eating.
Those are the main reasons I occasionally go to whole foods.
The fruits and vegetables on the list have low to undetectable levels of heavy metals, industrial chemicals, radiation, and pesticide residues, even though they are not grown or certified "organic".

Eating organically doesn't have to impact your wallet, as long as you know how to engage in some smart shopping techniques.
Not only will your produce be cheaper, it will also be more delicious.
You can also look into preserving and even pickling produce when it's cheap to get the most bang for your buck.
This may come as a surprise, but there are lots of suppliers who will sell you both fresh and frozen organic produce and meats and ship it directly to your door.
I've had incredible luck getting the produce and meats I want by cuddling up to the farmers, and they're usually happy to negotiate if I'm purchasing a lot.
Organic grains, beans and pastas all make quick and healthy meals.
Have a few organic canned items around too.
The bigger cans and jars will usually work out cheaper than the smaller ones, and you can freeze or store what you don't use right away.
Keeping an eye on sales at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and other supermarkets that specialize in healthy organic stuff is a key element to getting the best for your buck.
Your local grower is likely to have less mark up on their organic goods than the big stores and they will probably provide delivery as well, which is saving you even more money.
Health wise eating healthier and increasing your intake of fresh fruits and veggies will provide far more health benefits.
Yes, I care very much about what I buy and believe in using my power as a consumer to support local agriculture, reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use, and not support cruel factory farming practices.
I get fresh produce from a CSA (community supported agriculture) membership and then choose carefully when shopping in a supermarket (in order of priority: local, in season, organically grown, price).
I have the time (no kids) and the financial resources to be able to do this, so I like to think of it as doing my part to help bring down the prices of fresh and organically grown food for everyone.
Maybe that is a foolish rationalization of sometimes paying more, but I hate the idea of chemicals that can't be safely applied without a full protective suit and respirator on anyone's food!
But they may taste better, and will have more variety.
Sikkim is now a 100% organic state, with no chemical pesticides or fertilizers and no GMOs.
This matters because it shows that organic food in an entire region is possible.
Now, other people in India and throughout the world are learning from Sikkim’s success, and beginning to ask, “Could organic food succeed in other areas, too?” How Sikkim became a fully organic place In 2003, due to chemically intensive, conventional farming methods, the Himalayan state’s food production faced serious environmental and health problems.
As a solution, the Chief Minister of Sikkim, Pawan Chamling, announced his vision for Sikkim to be India’s first organic state.
On January 18, 2016, at Sikkim’s Organic Festival, the Prime Minister of India declared the state fully organic.
And they began using natural alternatives, such as compost and manure made from dung, decayed leaves, and dry grasses.
Various indigenous technologies were used, like pheromone traps to control fruit flies, biopesticides, and biofertilizers.
Why organic food is important Organic agriculture is important for our health and the future of our world for many reasons.
It carries far fewer toxic pesticide residues, and is grown using no GMOs.
Organic farming is also better suited to climate change, protects biodiversity, enhances soil fertility, and, to top it off, organic foods are more nutritious and taste better.
Many studies from around the world show that organic farms can produce about as much if not more food than conventional farms.
And in places where most of the world’s hungry live, yield gaps for organic food disappear.
Organic soil is better able to hold onto water because it uses organic material.
Therefore, plants have more access to water, and they produce more food.
When everything is organic, the price automatically falls.” How Sikkim is benefitting from becoming an organic state Sikkim’s transition to an organic state is good for public health and the environment in the area.
It’s also good for the economy.
Tourism to the area is also increasing and bringing in more money.
Guests can stay in organic villages, where they are able to enjoy the abundant natural beauty and eat fresh, organic meals.
Sikkim organic retail stores offering pulses, rice, mandarin oranges, ginger, cardamom, and turmeric have been set up by the government in New Delhi.
More stores are planned for other major cities.
Due to the surge in demand for Sikkim’s organic produce, farmers are now earning 20%more.
Now there are of course some very good benefits to organic food as well.
Organic foods usually have a wider variety of cultivars, resulting in more variety of taste and texture for a given food type.
But these benefits are not really heath based, they are more quality based.
This way - not only you get to know how your food is being produced - you get cheaper food, and farmers get better prices too, In Kolkata and Jamshedpur, there are 'haats/ market' organized once in a week or so .. where a group of farmers bring their produce and sell it directly to customers - the transportation and rent for the place is managed by the cooperative's funds (ngo shyamoli) .
Both these groups are consulted on their organic practices by the group of consumers/ local volunteers.
There are damaging ways to farm, and there are safe and sustainable ways.
Until the 20th century, all farming was organic, and the record of famine, erosion, plant disease, and permanently degraded soils is irrefutable.
Modern organic farmers in rich countries farm in a very responsible manner.
It is certainty true that farming without pesticides and herbicides will not present the risk of those chemicals getting into people, soils, air, or water.
For instance, I would mostly prefer to buy conventional food from the US or Australia/New Zealand to buying organic food from China.
So I guess the answer is to use organic methods on GM crops.
Personally I prefer organic, though I'm not on a fully organic diet.
For the 3rd reason is probably why Debbie thinks organic celery tastes better.
Its more flavorful because it isn't as saturated with water.
Same goes for watermelon, organic water melon tastes better and has a firmer texture.
Further more, I prefer local food.
I buy local because nutrition in food degrades over time, and I want to buy from a farmer that cares.
Just like a burger from a nice litter burger joint tastes better than from burger king.
Not only does the produce not travel as far, but the people who make your food actually care about your food and enjoy doing what they do.
Probably the biggest key to having more nutritious food is growing it yourself or buying local, nutrition degrades with time, and nutrition is at its peak when the plant is ripe.
Just buy local, talk to the farmer, see where your food is coming from.
So go for only FRESH Organic milk.
The genuine certified Organic Milk from recognized farms is produced without the use of pesticides, growth hormones, genetically modified organisms.
FRESH Organic milk has more fat-soluble nutrients - omega-3 fatty acid, Vitamin E and beta-carotene - than non-organic and long lasting organic milk.
Obviously FRESH Organic milk tastes better; milk as it used to taste, with a clear, pure and fresh flavor.
More on organic vs synthetic pesticides: Some organic approved pesticides are very benign (low hazard) materials, but so are a great many of the synthetic pesticides used by conventional farmers.
Likely the risks from either kinds of residue is very small for the consumer, however, and there is no reason for worry.
It seems to suggest that in the US organic artichokes, peas, sweet corn, sweet potatoes and snap beans may carry a smaller environmental burden than most other organic vegetables.

This is to substantiate the public opinion that we have on organic food being good for the health.
However, there are some scientific studies that have proved organic milk and organic tomatoes to be better than the non-organic varieties.
Studies are also ongoing about a variety of other types of organic food that may have additional health benefits compared to the non-organic varieties.
According to the researchers at the Danish Institute of Agricultural Research at the University of Aberdeen and the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research, organic milk is healthier than non-organic milk, since organic cows are pasture grazed which results in the better quality of milk.
This leads to an excessive formation of antioxidants, such as quercetin (79% higher) and kaempferol (97% higher) in organic tomatoes.
As we all know, antioxidants are good for health and help in reducing heart disease and the chances of developing cancer.
These studies have increased the hopes of numerous people who strongly believe that mankind should stop using chemical fertilizers and pesticides and shift to more sustainable organic farming practices.
Antioxidant Capacity A number of studies have been completed regarding the effects of antioxidants derived from organic foods on your overall health, and the predominant results have shown that antioxidants tend to have more of an impact when they come from organic foods.
This may be due to the fact that foreign chemicals are not negatively interacting with the different vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds that are so essential for the positive impact of fruits and vegetables in the prevention of things like cancer, heart disease, premature aging, vision problems, and cognitive malfunction.
Recent research suggests that choosing organic food can lead to increased intake of nutritionally desirable antioxidants and reduced exposure to toxic heavy metals.
Pesticide Reduction One of the major complaints that organic food consumers cite when choosing organic over non-organic is the presence of pesticides.
To be fair, many people do choose to go organic to make sure that their children grow up healthy and unaffected by the toxins of the world during their developmental years.

Natural fertilizers, like manure, work perfectly fine, and organic farmers are happy to use this smellier, yet safer, form of fertilizer.
Better Taste Some people strongly believe that organic food tastes better than conventional food.
Furthermore, organic food is often sold locally, resulting in availability of fresh produce in the market, which usually does taste better than produce that has been frozen, shipped, and transported across long distances.
Environmental Safety As harmful chemicals are not used in organic farming, there is minimal soil, air and water pollution; thus ensuring a safer and healthier world for future generations to live in.
Animal Welfare Animal welfare is an important aspect of producing organic milk, organic meat, organic poultry, and organic fish.
People feel happy that the animals are not confined to a miserable caged life when they eat organic animal products.
The below FAQs will help you understand organic food and its benefits in a better way What is Organic Food?
Normally people believe that organic food is better for your health than conventional food.
The exceptions are organic milk and organic tomatoes.
Recent studies on organic milk and organic tomatoes have shown that these food products are healthier than non-organic milk and non-organic tomatoes, respectively.
Many parents believe that organic food is safer for their children, since it does not contain any chemical pesticides and fertilizers.
So far, scientific research has proven this only for organic milk and organic tomatoes.
Organic milk has more omega-3, CLA, vitamins, and antioxidants than non-organic milk.
Similarly, organic tomatoes have more antioxidants than non-organic tomatoes.
Organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must have access to the outdoors and be given organic feed.
And i have also observed the taste difference between organic and the conventional products.
They say organic produce is good for the body in the long run.
In my 25 years as an organic farmer I have never used a pesticide of any sort.
I thought I didn't like them much until I began eating organic for certain foods.
Organic from several different providers have lacked the bitterness as well as the 'chemical' taste and are sweeter like a low sugar melon to my palate.
For vegetables, yeah, at least in terms of flavor.
(I find that the meats taste decidedly better, and I do believe the animals are treated better, albeit not nearly as well as I want them to be.)
Undoubtedly, some farm *workers* have been injured or killed by pesticides, something that would be unlikely on an organic farm, because the pesticides they are allowed to use are less concentrated.
If you wish to eat meat, organic pastured types (or those indicating that the animals were not given hormones) are the most recommended to avoid cause for concern in this regard.
And, organic methods can be as good as non organic...and in certain situations will outperform non organic methods, depending on how run down the soil biome and soil structure is due to abuse.
Organic fruits and vegetables have the potential to be more nutritious than conventional produce, but the reality depends on the details.
It has now been shown that organic dairy and meat has a different balance of fatty acids, one that has a higher proportion of omega-3s.
Fruits that ripen on the plant generally do have more vitamins and a different balance of sugars, fats, proteins, etc., than fruits that are picked when unripe and then ripened over time or with chemical stimulation.
So if your organic fruit comes from a local farm, it probably is slightly more nutritious and almost certainly tastes better.
Shopping the perimeter of the store where you find whole foods -- produce, meats/seafood, grains, dairy -- is a good start.
If you want to avoid GMOs, shop for certified organic products or products that have gone through the non-GMO verified.
I think it is fair to say that cows in an organic system are treated more humanely.
If a product is labeled organic then there are rigid standards to follow.
In simple terms organic refers to food that is grown without chemical fertilizers and pesticides which is theoretically better for your health since the body's immune system does not have to work so hard to remove these toxins ingested with the food; and also the soil condition is enhanced with natural composting methods which makes a healthier bio-system for microorganisms, insects and all creatures living downstream or upwind.
When you buy organic food you are paying for food clean from undesirable toxins and also paying the farmer to be a good caretaker of the land.
This means an organic farmer can’t plant GMO seeds, an organic cow can’t eat GMO alfalfa or corn, and an organic soup producer can’t use any GMO ingredients.
To meet the USDA organic regulations, farmers and processors must show they aren’t using GMOs and that they are protecting their products from contact with prohibited substances, such as GMOs, from farm to table.
Picking from the OTA’s press release U.S. organic sales post new record of $43.3 billion in 2015 For 2015 in the US: $43.3 billion in sales “Nearly 5% of all food sold in the US was organic” “Almost 13 percent of the produce sold in this country is now organic.” “Dairy accounts for 15 percent of total organic food sales.” “produce and dairy account for more than half of total organic food sales,” “non-food products account for just 8.2% of overall organic sales” “Growth in the non-food category was led by organic fiber, followed closely by organic supplements.” Organic consumption varies by location.
It shows much farm activity in the northeast, west coast and upper mid-west.
They break down very quickly into benign compounds.
There is no question that regular consumption of conventional produce leaves pesticide residues in the blood, which can be eliminated by switching to an organic diet.
It's never been proven that organic produce is more nutrient dense, so the answer is probably no, but without question eating organic food has benefits.
Organic foods aren't subjected to the potentially harmful pesticides or drugs that non organic foods generally are.
Organic foods follow a stringent protocol to be deemed organic, without a chemical in sight!
These chemical pesticides and drugs are of course deemed safe to inevitably end up in our diets, but many people, myself included, question this 'safety', and prefer food to be more natural and to be chemical and drug free.
In Germany (other European countries will be similar), the main differences are: The type of feed allowed The minimum area, the way that area is equipped and access to the outdoors per chicken required The type and amounts of pharmaceuticals allowed The facilities where the chickens are kept must be designed to allow them to engage in “natural” behaviour, like roosting, digging, taking sand baths and roaming around.
They need to have access to outdoor “pasture” for at least a third of the time, and be allowed an uninterrupted rest period without artificial light of eight hours per day.
The maximum amount of Chickens per coop is 3000 and no more than six per m² (still too many and too little space, IMHO, but better than other forms of industrial egg production).
The coops need to permanently admit fresh air and natural light.
The feed needs to be produced according to the standards for organic farming, as well, and be primarily grown locally.
No genetically engineered plants in it, no synthetically produced additives, no “preventative” antibiotics, steroids or what have you.
Specific organic farming co-ops/labelling systems usually follow stricter criteria, the above is pretty much the minimum for eggs to be labelled as organic.
So, to sum it up: Don’t buy any other eggs in Europe, except from a local farmer where the chickens are kept in small numbers with even more space who’s just too small to shell out for the certificate… The higher standards for the treatment of the chickens is well worth it, and the least we can do.
Help make keeping chickens in worse conditions unviable as a business model.
Glyphosate is also sprayed on a lot of non-GMO crop plantings, either before or after the growing of the crops, so there is a lot in things like millet, for instance, and it's also present in meat and especially edible organs -- so if you're going to cook liver, for instance, you absolutely, definitely want to get an organically raised animal's organs.
Anyway, the best advice is to buy organically certified foods if you can, especially when it comes to anything that's soy or corn based.

The general principles of organic production, from the Canadian Organic Standards (2006), embrace the following: defend the setting, minimize soil degradation and erosion, decrease pollution, optimize biological productivity and promote a sound state of health maintain semipermanent soil fertility by optimizing conditions for biological activity inside the soil maintain biological diversity inside the system recycle materials and resources to the best extent attainable inside the enterprise give attentive care that promotes the health and meets the behavioral desires of placental mammal prepare organic product, action careful process, and handling ways so as to keep up the organic integrity and important qualities of the product in the least stages of production think about renewable resources in regionally organized agricultural systems Organic farming promotes the utilization of crop rotations and canopy crops, and encourages balanced host/predator relationships.
Organic farmers find their method of farming to be profitable and personally rewarding.
Many want to buy food products that are free of chemical pesticides or grown without conventional fertilizers.
Product taste, concerns for the environment and the desire to avoid foods from genetically engineered organisms are among the many other reasons some consumers prefer to buy organic food products.

While were on it I would also argue organic animal husbandry = cruelty.
Definition #1“Organic meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.
This is the lowest quality version of organic and while you do have fewer pesticide residues and fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens, the nutritional quality is usually very close to the same.
On the other hand this version of organic really was invented to meet certain regulatory guidelines and many organic growers don’t even consider it “organic” at all.
In almost all cases this type of organic is hugely more nutritious than conventional.

You could just as easily say that organic farming methods are "normal" and the use of pesticides is not.
On organic/non-organic: You are aware that both systems of food production (at least in the United States) use chemicals, derived from raw sources or synthesised.
If people are willing to spend more for organic, a farmer will take the risk involved as long as there is an increased profit that goes with it.
(I use the quotes because it a silly term) It's expensive and no more nutritious than conventionally grown foods, though it does contain much lower levels of pesticide and herbicides, which I suspect one does not want to ingest a lot of.
If, however, you have the wealth to shop for everything in the organic market, I see nothing wrong with that.
Organic farming is slightly better for the land and the farmers than the even worse offenders in industrial processing, if only because the higher margins slightly reduce the incentives to commit environmental and labor atrocities.
It doesn't matter if that TV dinner is "organic" or not because it's been so highly processed to cram it full of extra tasty calories, fats, sugars, etc.

Full disclosure: I am an organic farmer, I know where I stand).
Organic food in the original sense of the term arose from a very real concern shared by many people for the quality and healthfulness of their food and the system of industrial agriculture that produces it.
In a deeper sense of the term, the growing popularity of Organic food reflects the desire of many people to eat food that is grown responsibly and thoughtfully, that among other things might involve care for animals and their well being, care for the people that do the work, concern for what happens downstream of the farm, interest in building and maintaining dynamic and sustainable rural communities, and/or the desire to create systems of agriculture that can endure into the indefinite future (...since our current system of industrial agriculture cannot).
What this gets at is that the growing of organic food is not just concerned with the health or quality of a carrot or an egg but rather in the process strives to build health in bigger ways too: that of the soil, of the farmer, of farm animals, of wild animals, of the farmer's community, of the consumer that he relies on, of biodiversity in general (for the earth's own sake, if not the various ecological services it provides, such as pollinators and other sorts of beneficial insects), of all people.
Unfortunately, even most people who seek organics are primarily concerned with the quality of what food goes into their body and less so with those other, more abstract things.
(ask me if it interests you how it can be more than that)
I do like the direction of organic and healthier, whole foods.
I also think those who choose those foods will benefit with better health and less disease!
The former is created strictly for yield, pest and disease resistance, the latter is gown to be as healthy as possible, (to increase yield, pest and disease resistance) You need rich, good dirt to grow organic, and the plants reflect that in nutritional quality.

Not to say I don't buy organic, but more important to me is to to buy local and to buy fresh untreated foods even from natural or supposed organic methods.
I'm more concerned with the taste than the politics.
I usually buy my fruits and vegetables at Farmer's Markets where everything is grown locally and therefore is very fresh and ripe.

When it comes to produce - organic means grown without the use of pesticides (“pesticides” here being a broad term that actually includes fungicides, herbicides, etc.).
- the animal was not fed pesticide-laden GMO crap) plus absence of added hormones and antibiotics, which contribute their own fair share of problems and diseases.
This means healthier animal who was not artificially “bulked up” to bring it to the market faster.
This means better quality meat and, more importantly, better quality fat.
Organic is what normal food should have been all along.
But I agree that there is a correlation between use of organic ingredients and reduced food processing, simply because producers often choose to do both of those things concurrently to maximize appeal to health-conscious consumers.

But not to eat it, I think) are also safe for humans and bees and there’s no point in paying extra for organic ones.
Are they worth the extra money?”
