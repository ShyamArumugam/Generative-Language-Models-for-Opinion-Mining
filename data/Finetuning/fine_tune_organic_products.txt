Organic farming is the only solution to get rid of these poisonous foods loaded with pesticides.
Number one is that you are not slowly poisoning yourself and the people you're serving (which if they are small children - are much more sensitive to these things and it's probably more likely to affect their development).
You're not deliberately putting toxins in their mouths that their body should not be exposed to for optimal health.
If you do, then spend the money if you have it.
People generally don’t buy Organic Food because of two reasons: High Cost Trust for the Organic Brand for which high price is paid.
Let me tell you first why Organic Food is expensive?
Organic food supply is limited as compared to demand; Production costs for organic foods are typically higher because of greater labour inputs per unit of output Post-harvest handling of relatively small quantities of organic foods results in higher costs because of the mandatory segregation of organic and conventional produce, especially for processing and transportation; Marketing and the distribution chain for organic products is relatively inefficient and costs are higher because of relatively small volumes.
In order to trust the Organic Brand you should check the norms (international and national)- like NPOP, USDA, etc - which have set the standards and which conform to these guidelines and certify producers.
Everything on the planet is organic - even man made things are compiled from organic elements.
Hey, the bestest apple in the world still has levels of Arsenic in it.
I dislike Whole Foods because it fosters the idea that healthy food costs too much.
While, as already metioned, that eating organic products usually prevent or at least deminish your intake of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics etc.
Another good reason for eating organic foods is for ethical reasons.
Many vegitarians and vegans could probably list many books and websites that explain and show all the horrific things that take place in these factories(these places are not farms) that mass produce beef, pork, chicken etc., but I am neither and will just compare it will organic animal husbandry practices.
Organic celery is a nice deep (almost electric) Green because it's gotten lots of sun which stimulates chlorophyll growth, and thus the flavor you and I like.
Also, the opposite of “organic” in the context it is typically used is “conventional”, not “GMO”.
As to your question, no, there are not significant difference in the environmental impacts of typical organic foods versus most conventional foods, or most GM foods.
I buy (mostly) organic because I want to (1) increase animal welfare (there are stricter regulations for the treatment of the animals in the Danish equivalent of “organic”) and (2) to avoid spreading pesticides, certain types of fertilizers, overuse of antibiotics, etc.
The advertising and reasons I could gather that most people bought organic was because they thought it was better for them.
I would say that while this is not perfect, they are worth the extra price.
But that is based on a view where I am taking a more holistic approach.
If you are only interested in the health benefits for you, then it really depends, and is not something that can be answered without a LOT of additional information.
The information I already asked about, but also things like how much money a certain increase in “health” (and what aspects of “health” you are talking about; “health” is a lot of different things all working together) is worth to you.
Very (VERY) simplistically, would one less sick day per lifetime and one more day alive be worth $1,000,000,000,000?
A relatively recent meta study (a study aggregating the results of several different studies) found no benefit: Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds .
There is decent evidence to suggest it is no better for your health and actually worse for the environment.
Additionally, a very large meta study conducted at Stanford found no health benefits to organic food.
But local and organic food are not synonymous.
Likewise I can get food labelled organic that is flown in from across the world.
The foods are proven no more safe and overall are likely worse for the environment.
I truly believe that the majority of "organic" produce sold in super markets is all about marketing and is misleading to the consumers.
I just want you to know I am not attacking your point on better farming practices, but just specifically the idea that organic food you buy at the super market is better than conventional.
But again, this isn't about organic but rather about heirloom foods (organic does not mean heirloom varieties).
Organic food is, more clearly, food grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers.
would mean "Certified Organic" under some public authority.. To be certified it would be cultivated under certain rules and perhap from an inspected farm.
Organic food is actively planted and managed using methods adapted to the plant and the local environment.
And then there are families or companies whose property is legally Certified Organic and they can sell a certified organic Main Wild Blueberry that you could also say was "Wildcrafted"
Organic foods refer to food items that are grown without the use of chemicals, fertilizers or any unnatural interference.
I assume so, because the food tastes better there, it is marked as organic, and emphasis is put on high quality products from responsible farmers.
"Natural" or "organic" pesticides (organic growers all use pesticides, they just use organic ones) can be just as safe/harmless as synthetic ones.
They can also just as dangerous , and they can sometimes be much, much worse !
Whether the pesticide was organic or not would not matter.
Last, several cases exist where organic pesticides are worse than synthetics.
Evidence shows that people who eat organic food have no health benefits compared to conventional agriculture food: they are neither healthier nor less sick, but do spend more.
If you are a grower, look at the labels on the pesticide and decide for yourself if it is toxic or not, but pay no heed to buzzwords like "natural," "organic," or "synthetic" that have no bearing on safety of efficacy, period.
The distinction between some of the organic and conventional foods on these store-shelves is going to be superficial at best.
Organic Standards are massively different in different countries.
As Evita Ochel points out there is solid research showing benefits from eating organic foods despite all these compromises that have been made to organic standards.
You may or may not agree with everything she says but her guides are a good start to educating yourself about food ingredients.
There's a lot of organic stuff round now, and supermarkets will clearly label those items.
The answer to your specific question is no, there has not been a noticeable impact yet.
Anyways there are no difference when it comes to the plant itself.
Craig, I've been eating organic vegan food for decades.
At 61, I'm healthier than many (if not most) people half my age.
It's not about fear of modernity, it's about love for the planet and all the species who call it home (although I'd rather live without bedbugs).
- Most corporations (like Monsanto and most others) distort data and flat out lie to make more profit.
Many apple and pear varieties are the result of orchardists fiddling, grafting etc.
Roses - Modified.
Organic food is far more likely to be higher quality in nutrition and taste.
Is Organic More Nutritious?
USDA But you need to be intelligent about it.
Organic certification does not guarantee any of these things.
Doubly ironic because the original purpose of the certification boards was to prevent industrial growers from fraudulently labeling food as organic that really wasn’t grown organically.
Organic food certainly does not solve any health risks of food, although their marketing may imply otherwise, and that you could call being duped.
Several comprehensive reviews support the view that there are no nutritional or health benefits from organic products.
I lay them out in this piece: Organic vs conventional food The summary: It must be reasonable to assume, that should there be a stable measurable difference in the nutritional content of organic food, other reviews would be able to arrive at that conclusion independently of each other.
Instead, we have four reviews on similar lines – finding no nutritional or health benefits of organic food.
Then we have one study stating a different conclusion, but at a closer look demonstrating very little differences for a few nutrients, likely at a level of no consequence for our health or nutrient intake.
When you talk about fruits and vegetables, most of the genetic enhancement and modification is done to improve taste and in this case organic foods do not taste better.
However, there is something a bit generic and bland about enhanced fruits and vegetables and something inherently original about their organic variants.
Organic fruits and vegetables are a lot healthier and have gained a lot of popularity in recent times.
Organic food is often fresher .
Fresh food tastes better.
Organic food is usually fresher because it doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer.
Organic food is GMO-free .
All organic produce are nutritionally equal in terms of vitamin profiles.
As in, organic produce is at a higher baseline toxicity (seeds are bred that way).
That means that organics are on the magnitude of 1,000 to 1,000,000 times more toxic.
The variations between organic and traditional foods stem directly from the farming ways that were used throughout the food’s production.
If difference is higher than 50%, consumers start to veer.
Other answers have very well explained why organic produce is costly in general.
India may account for 1 - 2% of the total organic produce worldwide.
Around 60 per cent of the country’s organic products were exported to the European Union, 20 per cent to the US, 5 per cent to Japan and the rest to Canada, Australia and East Asian countries. "
Few years ago, I read that organic tender coconut was priced at Rs.200 ($5 then), in an export market.
Can we afford Rs.200 for an organic tender coconut?
I would have bought 20 tender coconuts for the same price instead.
So I would say, the price factor for Indian organic produce is highly influenced by the lucrative global market, rather than anything else.
If more and more people switch to organic farming then price might come down coz of the lower demand which will lead to abandoning organic farming again.
Only way is for the people to get used to the slightly higher price of the organic produce.. Also some people charge more than adequate for organic stuff because of the increasing demand and lower supply.. Hope things change for good..
So, this food is healthier.
Recent studies are backing up what many thought: organic foods do indeed have a healthier nutritional profile than their conventional counterparts.
And they’re also lower in pesticide residues.
Eating organic fruits and vegetables could increase your antioxidant intake by 20-40%.
Organic strawberries have more nutrients and antioxidants than their conventional counterparts.
Organic tomatoes are 50% higher in vitamin C content than conventional tomatoes.
Then again, organic sugar, pasta, potatoes, rice, wheat products and corn are also not good for you as they can cause you to become addicted to sugar in its many forms and can lead to over-eating and obesity.
Kalgudi - Helping everyone across the globe with agricultural information You might think organic food would cost less than conventional food since the production is spared the cost of the chemicals, synthetic pesticides, and antibiotics.
Yet organic products typically cost 20 percent to 100 percent more than their conventionally produced equivalents.
Here are the top factors contributing to the high price of organic food 1.
Post-harvest handling cost In order to avoid cross-contamination, organic produce must be separated from conventional produce after being harvested.
Organic crops, however, are handled and shipped in smaller quantities since organic farms tend to produce less, and this results in higher costs.
Egg color only depends on the breed of chicken, not whether the egg is organic.
4) Forget organic premium; most of the produce can be sold locally at Grade A rates as traders know it's good quality.
Industrialization has actually brought down organic prices considerably; the price differentials used to be even higher.
organic food producing company based in Hyderabad that believes in the concept of natural food, or simply - as nature intended.
Extracted Information from link: Nutrient Levels in Organic Foods Until recently, the primary value of organic foods resided in just a few factors: 1) Lack of certain undesirable constituents, mainly pesticides, herbicides, petroleum-based fertilizers and genetically-modified organisms 2) Reduction in environmental degradation by not adding toxins to air, water and soil 3) Support of healthier, pesticide-free environments for farm workers However, organic gardeners and farmers have always suspected an added value of organically grown foods – higher levels of nutrients.
Dr. Benbrook’s research has established that organically grown vegetables and fruits contain higher levels of nutrients than their conventional counterparts.
Organic foods were found to be clearly higher in antioxidants, vitamin C, nitrates and some polyphenols; and moderately higher in protein.
Plant-based organic foods were consistently and clearly more nutrient dense, while animal-based organic foods were not consistently superior.
In 145 of the 236 matched pairs (61%), the organic foods were more nutrient dense.
In three-fourths of the cases, polyphenols and antioxidants were greater in organic than conventional foods.
Nutrient levels were on average 31% or more higher in organic foods than conventional in 25% of the study samples.
Across all 236 matched pairs and 11 nutrients, the nutritional premium of the organic food averaged 25%.
There are many reasons for these differences, and some of the details are interesting from a nutritional therapy perspective (Benbrook et al., 2008).
Antioxidants Numerous studies have found higher levels of antioxidants in organic produce than in conventional.
Organic tomatoes contained 79% and 97% higher levels of quercetin and kaempferol, respectively, in a long-term study conducted at the University of California – Davis (Mitchell AE et al., 2007).
An Italian research team seeking to create a test to distinguish between organic and conventional oranges found that vitamin C levels were higher in organic oranges (Tarozzi et al., 2006).
Organic red wines contain higher levels of resveratrol, polyphenols and other antioxidants (Di Renzo et al., 2007).
Benbrook’s team found that, in general, organically grown produce contains 30% higher levels of antioxidants than conventional produce.
No, There are real benefits of organic food for people and the environment.
There is no nutritional advantage to organic.
It is purely a marketing term.
100% I don’t want to let on that organic food is bad or any worse than conventionally farmed food.
It’s basically no better or worse, so when I say “100% overrated”, I mean that all of the purported advantages amount to nothing (and in most cases, are actually just plain myths).
An organic tomato grown in Florida is going to have poorer nutrient quality to a conventional tomato grown in California — that’s just down to soil.
Moreover, there are also studies that strongly indicate that the perceived flavor advantage of organic food is entirely down to expectations.
In blind tests, things come out basically even (again, assuming all else equal), but if people are told that one is organic and one is conventional, the one they were told is organic tends to win, even if the subjects of the study were actually misled.
Also, many people believe that organic food means no pesticides or herbicides.
That’s actually a myth.
What they’re not permitted to use is synthetic pesticides and herbicides.
In fact, all outbreaks of food-borne illness from vegetables sold in the U.S. in the last 30 years have been connected exclusively to organic vegetables.
From life, we can find that organic food is becoming more and more popular.
And the profits amon this area are self-evident.
Most of the time there is no added value to buying organic other than a nice happy feeling and a lighter wallet for you to carry around.
Their prepared foods section is typically much larger than that of competitors It typically has more choices of prepared foods Its options are typically healthier Whole Foods also carries vitamins & personal care products that some believe are healthier for you.
I actually think of 'natural foods' as being organic, minimally processed and without additives.
If you eat/buy organic to avoid industrial chemical and pesticide residues, then buying the foods that are on the current (2015) "Clean 15" list of commercially grown foods is an affordable option if you don't want to pay for organic.
The fruits and vegetables on the list have low to undetectable levels of heavy metals, industrial chemicals, radiation, and pesticide residues, even though they are not grown or certified "organic".
Buy organic varieties of these crops if you want to avoid GE produce.
It's great if GMO-free products want to voluntarily label themselves as GMO-free or organic.
A typical organic crop is 2% or more GMO DNA.
(Organic does not mean that less harm is caused to the environment.
Eating organically doesn't have to impact your wallet, as long as you know how to engage in some smart shopping techniques.
Try some of the following: 1) When it comes to organic produce, buy in season or buy frozen.
Not only will your produce be cheaper, it will also be more delicious.
Learn to stock your freezer when the prices are low for the later months.
You can also look into preserving and even pickling produce when it's cheap to get the most bang for your buck.
This may come as a surprise, but there are lots of suppliers who will sell you both fresh and frozen organic produce and meats and ship it directly to your door.
Doing this can cut out the middleman and save you a bunch.
Do a quick trawl on the internet for your favorites.
I've had incredible luck getting the produce and meats I want by cuddling up to the farmers, and they're usually happy to negotiate if I'm purchasing a lot.
This can be tough if you're living in a small apartment, but it's worth clearing the extra room to purchase in bulk when you can.
Organic grains, beans and pastas all make quick and healthy meals.
Have a few organic canned items around too.
The bigger cans and jars will usually work out cheaper than the smaller ones, and you can freeze or store what you don't use right away.
Keeping an eye on sales at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and other supermarkets that specialize in healthy organic stuff is a key element to getting the best for your buck.
Suggest finding a local grower/farmer who will sell you their organic fruit and vegetables - and hopefully their grass-fed, free-range meat and poultry too.
You want to maximise the life of your organic stash.
I get fresh produce from a CSA (community supported agriculture) membership and then choose carefully when shopping in a supermarket (in order of priority: local, in season, organically grown, price).
I have the time (no kids) and the financial resources to be able to do this, so I like to think of it as doing my part to help bring down the prices of fresh and organically grown food for everyone.
Maybe that is a foolish rationalization of sometimes paying more, but I hate the idea of chemicals that can't be safely applied without a full protective suit and respirator on anyone's food!
Ironically, that’s even truer with industrial organics, which have optimized to produce the same look and taste.
This matters because it shows that organic food in an entire region is possible.
And in places where most of the world’s hungry live, yield gaps for organic food disappear.
A way to make organic food cheap Organic food sometimes costs more.
Organic farming does not achieve the same yields as more modern farming techniques, so more land is used to grow the same amount of food.
Couple that with the odd definitions of organic in many countries and it often means that harsher, less targeted poisons (like Rotenone) are used for pest control, because they are more “natural”.
In fact some of the most toxic substances known to man are found in nature.
You can of course find local organic farms that use no pesticides whatsoever, just don’t expect to find their produce on the shelf at Safeway, because the food will not be all that attractive to your average consumer.
Now there are of course some very good benefits to organic food as well.
Organic foods usually have a wider variety of cultivars, resulting in more variety of taste and texture for a given food type.
But these benefits are not really heath based, they are more quality based.
Over all my personal feelings are the cost is not worth it, but your opinion may vary.
Just don’t tell me they are healthier/more environmentally friendly, when they clearly are not.
I'm not sure what you mean by 'organic medicine,' but I guess you want headaches to go away and these things have worked for me.
While you get 100 units production of organic tomatoes, you get 1000 units of tomatoes with pesticide planting, which protect the plant against plagues.
And, the durability and sensivity of organic foods makes it harder to transport and conservate.
The shelf life is shorter, meaning the product has a quicker expiration date.
Since it has a quicker expiration date, the item: A.
Can't be made in bulk, so costs go up.
To answer how organic food can be made cheap?
And finally, I'll build off what Bruce Ames has to say about all the worries about chemicals (and organic food).
We're eating natural pesticides, which are natural chemicals that plants use to try to kill off insects that try to eat them.
And we eat roughly 1,500 milligrams of them per day.
We eat 0.09 milligrams of synthetic pesticide residues.
So we're talking about incredibly tiny amounts of synthetic pesticides, and yet the same percentage of natural chemicals come out positive.
The differences are insignificant considering the wide array of agricultural practices you might define as "organic" or "conventional," and it's insignificant considering the many other unhealthy things we all do and eat.
Labels have very little to do with it.
For instance, I would mostly prefer to buy conventional food from the US or Australia/New Zealand to buying organic food from China.
Studies show there is no significant different in the nutritional value of organic food compared to non-organic.
Personally I prefer organic, though I'm not on a fully organic diet.
For the 3rd reason is probably why Debbie thinks organic celery tastes better.
Its more flavorful because it isn't as saturated with water.
Same goes for watermelon, organic water melon tastes better and has a firmer texture.
Further more, I prefer local food.
I buy local because nutrition in food degrades over time, and I want to buy from a farmer that cares.
Just like a burger from a nice litter burger joint tastes better than from burger king.
Not only does the produce not travel as far, but the people who make your food actually care about your food and enjoy doing what they do.
Probably the biggest key to having more nutritious food is growing it yourself or buying local, nutrition degrades with time, and nutrition is at its peak when the plant is ripe.
Almost all vegetables and fruits in the super market are artificially ripened, even if its labeled organic.
Just buy local, talk to the farmer, see where your food is coming from.
But do not trust everything with "Organic" labelled on it !
Many organic dairy products available in the market are either UHT or treated some how to ensure longer shelf life.
So go for only FRESH Organic milk.
The genuine certified Organic Milk from recognized farms is produced without the use of pesticides, growth hormones, genetically modified organisms.
FRESH Organic milk has more fat-soluble nutrients - omega-3 fatty acid, Vitamin E and beta-carotene - than non-organic and long lasting organic milk.
Obviously FRESH Organic milk tastes better; milk as it used to taste, with a clear, pure and fresh flavor.
Here's a great example for a genuine certified organic FRESH milk from UK'Darlington Farms' by Acorn Dairy.
It is certified Organic by the UK Soil Association, Red Tractor certified - UK’s recognised farm and quality food assurance scheme.
This question probably makes the assumption that organic food has quality or health benefits.
I lay them out in my post here: Organic vs conventional food Quality-wise, people may argue they can taste the difference.
This, however, is a poor way to truly determine nutrition or truly, even taste perception, as being told the food is organic makes people rate it higher .
In this regard organic pesticides are no more benign than conventional , you can see comparisons with conventional and organic pesticides and other everyday chemicals in a table in this post: The dose makes the poison.
A comment on that study: Until recently, nobody bothered to look at natural chemicals (such as organic pesticides), because it was assumed that they posed little risk.
But when the studies were done, the results were somewhat shocking: you find that about half of the natural chemicals studied are carcinogenic as well.
We assumed that “natural” chemicals were automatically better and safer than synthetic materials, and we were wrong.
Some organic-approved pesticides are slightly to moderately toxic.
In any case, organic-approved pesticides definitely leave residues on treated crops by the time they reach the consumer.
- Why You Can Feel Guilt-free Buying Non-Organic Produce Unfortunately, we're in the dark about organic pesticide residues.
Unfortunately, I learned that this new testing program is only there to encourage compliance with the organic rules, not to document anything about relative residue levels.
Likely the risks from either kinds of residue is very small for the consumer, however, and there is no reason for worry.
The cost of buying organic is felt by your wallet and the environment, as organic farming at present unfortunately exerts a greater toll on our natural resources than conventional farming - it demands more land, and produces more nitrogen run-off for instance.
Meanwhile, what would be best for the environment were to only choose to buy organic for those crops where yield is not much lower (lower yields = more wasted resources), or even higher than conventional.
It seems to suggest that in the US organic artichokes, peas, sweet corn, sweet potatoes and snap beans may carry a smaller environmental burden than most other organic vegetables.
There is zero health or nutritional benefit to be gained by spending twice what you need to on organic.
The sweeping public opinion that organic food is healthier than conventional food is quite strong, and is the main reason for increase in its demand over the past 5-6 years.
This is to substantiate the public opinion that we have on organic food being good for the health.
First of all, there is a small amount of scientific evidence to show that organic food is better in quality than conventional food.
Scientific research conducted thus far on various organic food items has not been able to give strong evidence about the superiority of organic food over non-organic food.
However, there are some scientific studies that have proved organic milk and organic tomatoes to be better than the non-organic varieties.
Studies are also ongoing about a variety of other types of organic food that may have additional health benefits compared to the non-organic varieties.
According to the researchers at the Danish Institute of Agricultural Research at the University of Aberdeen and the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research, organic milk is healthier than non-organic milk, since organic cows are pasture grazed which results in the better quality of milk.
Organic Tomatoes According to a 10-year study conducted by the University of California, Davis, organic tomatoes are produced in an environment that has a lower nutrient supply since nitrogen-rich chemical fertilizers are not added.
This leads to an excessive formation of antioxidants, such as quercetin (79% higher) and kaempferol (97% higher) in organic tomatoes.
As we all know, antioxidants are good for health and help in reducing heart disease and the chances of developing cancer.
There are many studies that prove that there is some pesticide and fertilizer contamination in non-organic food, and there are others which claim that organic food is not healthy because they contain harmful bacteria and viruses because of not using strong chemicals to protect against these toxic substances.
Health Benefits Of Organic Food In general, organic food consumers, manufacturers, and farmers strongly believe that organic food has the following benefits compared to conventional food.
Antioxidant Capacity A number of studies have been completed regarding the effects of antioxidants derived from organic foods on your overall health, and the predominant results have shown that antioxidants tend to have more of an impact when they come from organic foods.
This may be due to the fact that foreign chemicals are not negatively interacting with the different vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds that are so essential for the positive impact of fruits and vegetables in the prevention of things like cancer, heart disease, premature aging, vision problems, and cognitive malfunction.
Recent research suggests that choosing organic food can lead to increased intake of nutritionally desirable antioxidants and reduced exposure to toxic heavy metals.
Pesticide Reduction One of the major complaints that organic food consumers cite when choosing organic over non-organic is the presence of pesticides.
To be fair, many people do choose to go organic to make sure that their children grow up healthy and unaffected by the toxins of the world during their developmental years.

CLA is a heart-healthy fatty acid that can boost cardiovascular protection, and it is found in higher quantities in breast milk and in meat for animals that have been raised free range or cage-free.
Also see Best 5 Organic Food & Grocery Stores in Manchester, NH Top 6 Organic & Health Food Stores in Petaling Jaya Overall Health Since organic food is not prepared using chemical fertilizers, it does not contain any traces of these strong chemicals and might not affect the human body in negative ways.
Better Taste Some people strongly believe that organic food tastes better than conventional food.
Furthermore, organic food is often sold locally, resulting in availability of fresh produce in the market, which usually does taste better than produce that has been frozen, shipped, and transported across long distances.
Animal Welfare Animal welfare is an important aspect of producing organic milk, organic meat, organic poultry, and organic fish.
People feel happy that the animals are not confined to a miserable caged life when they eat organic animal products.
The below FAQs will help you understand organic food and its benefits in a better way What is Organic Food?
On an overall basis, organic food is food prepared and processed without using any chemicals.
That is, organic food production does not involve the use of chemical fertilizers, chemical pesticides, or chemical preservatives.
Normally people believe that organic food is better for your health than conventional food.
Scientific research has also not been able to conclusively prove that organic food is healthier than conventional food because there has been counter research too to prove conventional food is better than organic one.
The exceptions are organic milk and organic tomatoes.
Recent studies on organic milk and organic tomatoes have shown that these food products are healthier than non-organic milk and non-organic tomatoes, respectively.
Yes, organic food normally costs 20% to 100% more than conventional food.
Many parents believe that organic food is safer for their children, since it does not contain any chemical pesticides and fertilizers.
So far, scientific research has proven this only for organic milk and organic tomatoes.
Organic milk has more omega-3, CLA, vitamins, and antioxidants than non-organic milk.
Similarly, organic tomatoes have more antioxidants than non-organic tomatoes.
While the regulations vary from country to country, in the U.S., organic crops must be grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, bioengineered genes (GMOs), petroleum-based fertilizers, and sewage sludge-based fertilizers.
Organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must have access to the outdoors and be given organic feed.
Actually i see there’s a lot of hype created for organic vegetables , fruits and food stuff.
organic vegetables and fruits are beleived to be grown without the use of pesticides and fertilizers but i doubt how much is that possible?
And i have also observed the taste difference between organic and the conventional products.
They say organic produce is good for the body in the long run.
But i personally prefer the conventional vegetables and fruits washed well and consumed.
I thought I didn't like them much until I began eating organic for certain foods.
Organic from several different providers have lacked the bitterness as well as the 'chemical' taste and are sweeter like a low sugar melon to my palate.
Organic food can taste bland as it isn't enhanced by artificial additives.
You can still get fresh food, organic or not, but in the 1950's it would have been more commonplace that any given diner dealt with fresher ingredients.
That's going to taste much the same as regular supermarket milk.
Some organic products happen to also be locally-grown, grass-fed, etc.
(I find that the meats taste decidedly better, and I do believe the animals are treated better, albeit not nearly as well as I want them to be.)
It's not a guarantee.
Today's natural foods, of course, are much cleaner, but many are still sickened and occasionally killed by e.coli, listeria, and salmonella, largely on account of the manure fertilizer.
The number is far greater than those whose health might have been damaged by minute pesticide residues.
If you wish to eat meat, organic pastured types (or those indicating that the animals were not given hormones) are the most recommended to avoid cause for concern in this regard.
No, not all food is organic, and a thoughtful and thorough answer will take longer than I have on my phone battery.
Preying mantises to eat destructive aphids, pulling weeds from the ground, and manure for fertilizer.
Not worth the paper they’re printed on, to be more blunt about it.
A farmer growing organic corn can sign up for programs that all corn growers can sign up for.
It's not like there's any nutritional difference between organic, non-organic, GMO and non-GMO foods.
Organic fruits and vegetables have the potential to be more nutritious than conventional produce, but the reality depends on the details.
As Ryan Carlyle explains, the use of pesticides and fertilizers doesn't appear to affect nutritive value.
See Why Organic Food May Not Be Healthier For You for a summary.
It has now been shown that organic dairy and meat has a different balance of fatty acids, one that has a higher proportion of omega-3s.
New Study Adds To The Evidence .
Fruits that ripen on the plant generally do have more vitamins and a different balance of sugars, fats, proteins, etc., than fruits that are picked when unripe and then ripened over time or with chemical stimulation.
So if your organic fruit comes from a local farm, it probably is slightly more nutritious and almost certainly tastes better.
If your "organic" produce is also "heirloom," you are eating more nutritious food.
But if you're more concerned about "bang for your buck," a balanced diet of conventional foods is an easier way to stay healthy.
Shopping the perimeter of the store where you find whole foods -- produce, meats/seafood, grains, dairy -- is a good start.
There is also no demonstrated food safety or nutritional difference between organic milk and conventional milk.
If this matters to you, feel free to pay the price premium that organic milk provides.
Why is organic food produce more expensive than conventionally grown fruits, vegetables and grains?
I also wonder if organic food is overpriced or is all conventional supermarket foods underpriced.
Once opened it's no longer aseptic, so you have to refrigerate it, but it's so sterile that it will last longer than milk conventionally pasteurized.
Organic milk tends to be UHT pasteurized because it was shipped so far; there used to be relatively few organic dairies.
You can get UHT conventional milk (sometimes even on the shelves next to the dried and evaporated milk), but for the most part UHT and organic go hand in hand.
That makes a relatively small dent in the price of organic milk, which is already a premium.
But if I have $50 for groceries and tomatoes are $1.99 and the organic tomatoes are $4.99, I'm probably going to go and buy the normal tomatoes.
Because we are not rich and I like to feed my family and not have them die.
If a product is labeled organic then there are rigid standards to follow.
When you buy organic food you are paying for food clean from undesirable toxins and also paying the farmer to be a good caretaker of the land.
All other animal by-products like blood meal, bone meal, and fish meal are prohibited due to BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or Mad Cow Disease) concerns.
There is very little difference between organic vs. conventional dairy production.
Roughly 4-5% of US food sales are organic according to the Organic Trade Association (OTA) and old data from the USDA (at Organic Market Overview).
Picking from the OTA’s press release U.S. organic sales post new record of $43.3 billion in 2015 For 2015 in the US: $43.3 billion in sales “Nearly 5% of all food sold in the US was organic” “Almost 13 percent of the produce sold in this country is now organic.” “Dairy accounts for 15 percent of total organic food sales.” “produce and dairy account for more than half of total organic food sales,” “non-food products account for just 8.2% of overall organic sales” “Growth in the non-food category was led by organic fiber, followed closely by organic supplements.” Organic consumption varies by location.
There is no question that regular consumption of conventional produce leaves pesticide residues in the blood, which can be eliminated by switching to an organic diet.
Can you show any evidence that an organic diet results in significant pesticide residues in the human body?
Broad labels that have absolutely no meaning.
A chemist will say anything is organic.
Glyphosate is also sprayed on a lot of non-GMO crop plantings, either before or after the growing of the crops, so there is a lot in things like millet, for instance, and it's also present in meat and especially edible organs -- so if you're going to cook liver, for instance, you absolutely, definitely want to get an organically raised animal's organs.
Anyway, the best advice is to buy organically certified foods if you can, especially when it comes to anything that's soy or corn based.
I eat local eggs, some locally raised meat, good quality butter, olive oil, lots of fresh vegetables, and some processed foods (organic or made from organic ingredients).
I have decided that I will live with organic food as the lesser evil.
I often travel in the US and always buy organic foods there.
I also recently traveled to Europe and bought organic food as much as I could.
By avoiding it as much as possible I hope that I live a healthier life.
Organic food may not be the best, but it is all we have left under the USDA.
I know morons go on about how it tastes better or is “healthier”, and that none of this is backed up by the large number of studies.
For example almost all honey's can be labelled organic.
But nobody can really know what a bee is getting its necter from.
So I wouldn't pay any extra for organic honey.
But I would pay extra for an organic chicken.
Some crops are more challenging than others to grow organically; however, nearly every commodity can be produced organically.
Product taste, concerns for the environment and the desire to avoid foods from genetically engineered organisms are among the many other reasons some consumers prefer to buy organic food products.
Many French wines from Burgundy are made according to biodynamique methods, which goes way beyond organic standards.
However, many new brands are offering quality organic products.
It is very tough to say they are 100% organic.
To the some extent you can trust the organic certification.

Emphasis on organic and non-processed foods.
There are various websites for buying organic food online.
There is also the notion that food without “chemicals” is pure, when there are vegetables that can kill or harm people that have been bred conventionally.
Which ironically, is the same pesticide used in organic produce.
Organic foods may cost less to produce, but that is not a significant reason for the higher price.
(I use the quotes because it a silly term) It's expensive and no more nutritious than conventionally grown foods, though it does contain much lower levels of pesticide and herbicides, which I suspect one does not want to ingest a lot of.
If, however, you have the wealth to shop for everything in the organic market, I see nothing wrong with that.
I think organic food is more expensive per unit to produce because the pesticides and herbicides used in modern farming (along with the mechanization) allow for more units to be produced per allotted space.
Another aspect is there is some degree of over pricing because people perceive greater value in organic food, and they are willing to pay for it.
As owner of a business selling natural and organic products, I know I have competitors pricing products much higher than their costs of production.
The good reasons revolve around trying to grow the plant in an environment close to the one it evolved in.
And it involves a lot of human labor, not easily mechanized, because mechanization works best in monocultures and the whole point is to avoid monoculture.
The rest of "organic", as a USDA certified label, is the bad reasons.
Which, to get back to the point of the question, means taking those "natural" pesticides, concentrating them, and applying them to vast monocultures.
Here's the deal: organic food is not lower in "toxins".
You do need to get over your fear of "chemicals" because it's ALL chemicals.
The industrial versions of organic are slightly less destructive.
Do that, and you'll do better for both your health and the environment.
While many people believe that food grown organically is better for you, they may not be able to tell you exactly why it is better for you.
The absence of pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables is a fairly obvious benefit but there are more other far-reaching advantages of going organic.
You may also want to read Five Reasons to Make the Big Switch to Organic Food Footnotes [1] WHY ORGANICS oFarm Organic Grocers
From first hand experience, I can tell you that organic vegetables are more likely to have pest damage.
The first time I bought organic, I bought a zucchini, and sliced it in half right through a worm that had apparently been living inside it.
People have a common perception that organic vegetables are larger and healthier, but this is due to selection bias.
I regularly attend one of the largest farmer-only farmer's markets in the US, and the organic crops are typically pitiful compared to the commercially fertilized ones.
Local and Organic foods typically give you more nutrition for the buck...but be sensible.
Even though they do face issues like scarcity of vegetable and fruit supplies, they are doing good on the groceries part.
We have also seen web portals exclusive for organic products entering the market with heavy investments.
I would definitely recommend organic milk over any super market milk.
A long term use of these synthetic chemicals can be very harmful for the gut bacteria in human gut.
There is lot of new research linking various disease to gut bacteria imbalance.
Remember, you are paying a premium for organic food because of the absence of synthetic fertilisers, chemical sprays, insecticides and pesticides, among other measures.
The real argument for eating organic food is that it is an alternative to a food system that is unsustainable and damaging to ecosystems, farm workers, fresh water, and pretty much all of the resources we require to survive.
A lot has been made about people eating organic to be healthy but there are a lot of ways to be healthy.
All things considered I would argue that Local food is probably the most healthy choice, in both nutrient content and overall footprint.
As such anything labeled as organic in the grocery store is more expensive than it should be.
So where it is easy to have a ship full of corn moving to markets, it would seem to me that organic fruit and vegetables are more vulnerable to damage in transit.
In those cases, aim not for organic but naturally raised.
By the same argument, you might also consider organic for oils.
For more information on that look here: Scott Strough's answer to Is organic food more nutritious?
Scott Strough's answer to Why is organic food (basically organic vegitables and fruits) in USA much more expensive than any other country?
Organic foods also regulate the use of food additives and processing aids such as artificial sweeteners, flavors, and coloring agents.
I don't often buy organic foods for a few reasons: The jury's still out on the health benefits of organic food.
It's often worse for the environment.
Here in the U.S. much of our organic produce is shipped to us from other parts of the world, offsetting much of the benefit of reducing chemical run off.
And using animal products like manure as fertilizer also carries the risk of disease transmission, so organic produce should still be scrubbed thoroughly before eating it.
That being said, there is one type of food I consistently buy organic: milk.
I buy organic milk because of the widespread use of antibiotics in dairy cows and the increasing threat of antibiotic-resistant microbes in our environment.
But this is a choice I based more on my desire to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial treatment in general rather than any health benefits associated with organic milk.
For more information, see : Organic Food Has No Benefits Over Conventional Food, Says Study Are Organic Foods Safer or Healthier Than Conventional Alternatives?
: A Systematic Review Nutritional quality of organic foods: a syste... [Am J Clin Nutr.
So if the water used to irrigate the crops is highly contaminated industrial wastewater full of pollutants and heavy metals, you can still claim the product is organic.
It is produced according to organic farming principles which are committed to working in harmony with nature rather than against nature.
Organic farming works within the natural confines of the farming eco-system to provide you with great tasting food!
Wow sounds healthy but practically is expensive for middle class you can compare the price of organic food products.
Plenty of natural food sources have dangerous enzymes, acids and chemicals which can be deadly or harmful if not used properly or if not used in moderation.
The source of the chemical is not any guarantee as to the overall safety of the chemical.
Plenty of natural and organic foods we eat every day have potentially harmful ingredients in varying quantities.
Just take your geiger counter to the spice aisle *1 or the fruit aisles and you will see.
By the same token many common man made chemicals we use every day for medicinal and industrial uses are perfectly safe and even beneficial in low doses (aspirin for example) but deadly in higher concentrations too.
Plenty of certified organic ingredients can be harmful in large and small doses.
Plenty of certified organic pesticides will kill a human as easily as kill a bug.
Are you going to eliminate organic crops from your diet because of their pesticide residues?
Based on available science, that actually seems like the safest way to go, and I try to avoid organic produce when shopping.
Any reputable peanut butter in a reasonably regulated food chain will be safe from aflatoxin.
Organics will usually contain essential oils like tea tree, orange, clove leaf etc.
It's not necessary to buy all organic fruits and vegetables if cost is an issue.
Here is a list of the Clean 15, ie, fruits and vegetables that bear little to no pesticides: onions avocados sweet corn pineapples mango sweet peas asparagus kiwi fruit cabbage eggplant cantaloupe watermelon grapefruit sweet potatoes sweet onions Then there are the Dirty Dozen, the fruits and vegetables that, if at all possible, should be purchased organic.
They are: celery peaches strawberries apples domestic blueberries nectarines sweet bell peppers spinach, kale and collard greens cherries potatoes imported grapes lettuce If you purchase the Dirty Dozen non-organic, make sure that you wash them really well before eating.
From the Scientific American Why does organic milk last so much longer than regular milk?
Because of the longer transit times organic milk is heated to a higher temperature killing all bacteria.
The common thing that happens when people start to eat more healthy alternatives is that they try to change their diet to a better.
My personal experience with the two is that some food tastes better (tomatoes, chicken).
Actually, no, I don't.
At least, I do not have a strong preference for organic food.
There was a study done a few months ago and it found that basically, there is slightly more pesticide residue on conventional fruits and vegetables than on organic fruits and vegetables.
The washing will take care of the traces of pesticide remaining.
While poisoning from pesticides is extremely unlikely, bacterial or parasitic contamination of our food supply is relatively common.
All it takes is one episode of food poisoning or one class in parasitology and anyone who thinks about it will be very shy of ordering raw oysters, sashimi, seared tuna, or a rare steak.
That goes for both conventional and organic fruit -- the organic stuff doesn't have as much sprayed on it, but it does have more exposure to illness-causing contaminants like e. coli.
And all grocery store fruit is pawed through all day by produce clerks and other shoppers.
And ripe organic fruit spoils in days rather than weeks.
But organic crops are fertilized too -- they're just fertilized with stuff like manure and crop waste.
On one hand, this creates a much greater opportunity for transmission of food-borne illness.
(This risk seems to offset any possible health gains from organic food.)
On the other hand, natural fertilizer contains a wider range of plant nutrients than sterile chemical fertilizer does.
This is why some organic produce tastes better than conventional produce.
Anyway, studies have shown that organic foods offer little/no health benefit over the same conventional produce.
That's a pretty good sign that they don't contain more nutrients.
I mean, they could, but it would have to be a minuscule improvement below the detection threshold of scientific studies.
And if the difference is too small to be statistically detectable, I really don't think we should worry too much about it.
There are a few cases where organic food probably is better: I personally think organic bananas taste a little better than regular bananas.
(Not enough to pay more for them, but still.)
If you're making orange or lemon zest, you should use organic fruit to avoid the fungicides and fruit dyes used on citrus skins.
If you really hate wax on your apples, it's easier to buy organic apples than clean conventional ones.
It's not fruit, but organic milk lacks some antibiotics and hormones that have been linked to health effects in humans.
In general , there isn't much benefit to organic food.
Unfortunately, at this point most food labeled organic is done so primarily as a marketing strategy, as the trendiness of organic food has been largely co-opted by business interests and Big Ag.
Most organic food sold in large retail outlets is grown very similarly to the conventional alternatives, with negligible differences concerning the ecological or social impacts, and questionable health gains to the consumer (the Internet is full of studies both professing and denying the healthfulness of organic over conventional.
Organic food in the original sense of the term arose from a very real concern shared by many people for the quality and healthfulness of their food and the system of industrial agriculture that produces it.
What this gets at is that the growing of organic food is not just concerned with the health or quality of a carrot or an egg but rather in the process strives to build health in bigger ways too: that of the soil, of the farmer, of farm animals, of wild animals, of the farmer's community, of the consumer that he relies on, of biodiversity in general (for the earth's own sake, if not the various ecological services it provides, such as pollinators and other sorts of beneficial insects), of all people.
Unfortunately, even most people who seek organics are primarily concerned with the quality of what food goes into their body and less so with those other, more abstract things.
I do like the direction of organic and healthier, whole foods.
I also think those who choose those foods will benefit with better health and less disease!
We make frozen food so I am biased, but I disagree with Sonnet that buying organic frozen food doesn't matter.
If you want to eat organic fresh vegetables, why wouldn't you want to eat organic frozen vegetables?
I'm willing to pay a premium for organic, but not 2x and I am willing to pay a greater premium for vegetables, fruits and berries than I am for nuts and grains.
Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds
Now, given that organic foods aren't very strictly policed, and that most GMOs other than Monsanto corn do release pollen, I would guess that there's some cross breeding here or there.
TL/DR: There are no good reasons to believe that eating organic has any meaningful benefits for your heath or the environment when compared to conventional agriculture.
long version: Depending on what you're eating, where and how it's grown and numerous other factors, there could be some benefit to choosing organic over conventional.
Though organic produce typically has slightly higher mineral and vitamin contents than conventionally grown produce, the diffence is slight and can be compensated for by eating slightly more fruit, which you can afford more easily by not buy organic.
Daniel's answer says that organic produce contains less heavy metals, but without some legitimate sources to back that claim, I'd assume that heavy metal concentrations would be similar.
Mostly anything in the produce, dairy and meat department can be purchased organic.
If you aren’t sure just go to a natural food store and look for anything that say’s organic and Non-GMO on it and you will be safer.
Going organic is not easy, I started with my milk, then went to Free Range eggs which is better than caged.
Organic vegetables and fruit have a sticker on it that begins with a “9”.
Organic food is not necessarily healthier than non GM food.
However, organic food alone is often less healthy than its processed counterpart.
Organic food is not healthier: Stanford U.
Why Organic Food May Not Be Healthier For You However, in many, many cases, organic food is going to have a worse impact on the environment.
Can eating locally, organically hurt the environment?
The most obvious fact, in my opinion, is the average cost of organic food over regular food.
With a quick glance at this chart: Organic Versus Non-Organic; Store Versus Farmers’ Market One can see that the price of organic food is significantly higher, in many cases over 80%.
TL;DR: spend the money on directly helping the environment instead of buying organic.
Except on the basis of cost, for those who can't afford to pay a premium for certified organic goods.
Yes: organic farmers can still use herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides so long as they are "organic".
No: organic foods have not been shown to be more nutritious than conventional ones.
Yes: organic foods have been shown to contain significantly less pesticides of all kinds than conventional ones Yes: some pesticides have been shown to be harmful The fact is, we don't know everything about health, and we never will.
However, local food is more nutritious than organic or conventional produce that has been shipped thousands of miles.
you purchase organic food items at reasonable prices.
I myself buy organic products online mostly from tradus.com at affordable rates in India.
Organic fruits and vegetables are high in demand slowly there is a cultural shift towards organic lifestyle and people are more aware of their health.
Organic products don't contain synthetic pesticides or fungicides.
There are a number of reasons people buy organic: 1.
To avoid the normal allotted amount of pesticides the FDA normally appoves 2.
To avoid the added antibiotics and hormones.
Taste preference 6.
Another perspective: there's no such thing as organic wine.
If you're committed to consuming organic products, there are a good many quite tasty wines made from organic grapes, although I would steer you clear of domestic products and brands that are designed expressly to take advantage or your predilections and beliefs.
Instead, I'd point you at major European growers and vintners who subscribe to biodynamic practices.
Not, mind you, because I think these practices are scientifically sound.
A lot of biodynamic agriculture is superstition.
But many of those vintners can make a great bottle of wine!
He is absolutely incorrect in suggesting that extra pesticides or herbicides are used.
They are not pesticide and chemical free, they are grown with “organic approved” pesticides and chemicals, which is code for “untested”.
If I had to restrict my tea diet to only those that are 'certified organic', my soul would be crushed, a far worse consequence in my opinion.
Since I don't generally buy from Western vendors, I don't care very much for teas that are certified organic.
There is little point in consuming a poor quality tea that has been certified organic.
The main reason organic food costs more is because of the fees the federal government charges to use the term organic.
No country produces "mostly" Certified Organic Food.
(e.g.,, to use US standards, food that contains only organic ingredients, or is "made with" at least 70% organic ingredients).
For example, in a lot of Latin American countries, over 85% of organic produce is exported.
I wanted to explain the difference between whole foods and organic whole foods.
Let’s compare something like regular chicken with organic free range chicken.
The problem with the term organic is that it is ambiguous.
While an organic food should theoretically be more nutritious, since they are not pumped with hormones and pesticides, the rules are so vague that it’s not a guarantee you’re getting food that is of significantly higher quality.
There are certifying bodies in all countries that certify & ensure the authenticity of organic produce.
Know the certifying bodies for your country & what they do and do not allow.
In many countries the words 'organic', 'bio', and 'biologically' are legally regulated.
Meaning of 'bio' and 'organic'Since you used the word 'bio' in your question I suspect you are from Europe, because both 'bio' and 'biological' are used in many EU-countries (with a Latin or Germanic language) to refer to what native-English speakers call organic food.
I assume that with 'bio' you mean 'organic' and not bio-based products.
Basically an organic label on a food is a guarantee that the food was produced according to organic farming principles.
Organic food in EuropeFood in EU-member states may only contain the words 'bio', 'biological' or 'organic' if specific regulations are followed in its production and if the producer has been certified by the proper authorities.
Products from the hunting or fishing of wild animals do not qualify as organic.
In other countries such as the US, Canada or Australia, the basic idea of an organic product is the same, but some of the regulations are a bit different.
For example, the number of pesticides allowed in the US is much larger and includes some synthetic pesticides.
Furthermore, the fruits are healthier for having done their own bug resistance.
The highest quality organic beef would likely come from an organic Managed Intensive Rotational Grazing (MIRG) operation - where the steers are all rotated onto new micropastures every day or two - and supplemented or even finish fed with a mixture of organic grains, organic corn, and minerals.
Huge injected chicken is typically not the most expensive, but organic is.
Organic fruit will almost always have blemishes, spots, and sometimes bruises.
In sum, a farmer who is concerned about organically grown fruit and meat will also likely be concerned about quality and ecology.
As a consumer who purchases organic food could look in to two aspects, producers and distributors.
We have a wide variety of products from tribal, socio economic backward groups, women self help groups etc.
Restaurants and grocers will convince Americans to spend more on their produce, and consumers get the satisfaction of both the actual and imagined benefits of eating organically.
There are other perhaps more convoluted stories that may be told depending on the source of the organic food.
Because people are easily fooled into believing stuff that isn’t true.
Unless it is backed up by hard science, I ain’t buying it.
Same goes for organic food.
Organic foods are supposedly better for you, but this is misleading.
Organic food no more nutritious than conventionally grown food - Harvard Health Blog I am not going to spend three times as much money for a bunch of fruit or veggies just because someone smacked an ‘organic’ label on it.
Organic might be healthier, but there is no hard and fast proof they they are.
I don’t buy organic foods for the same reason I don’t go to a chiropractor.
Neither one of them has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that what they say is true actually is true.
I can grow organic foods in my own garden or get them from a local Farmer’s Market, and avoid the over-priced stuff in the grocery store easily enough.
(I know a bunch of people will want to jump my ass for this answer, but I follow science, not fads).
There's no way of knowing that the organic food did it.
Some petrochemicals are edible.
Organic doesn't "help the environment".
So I'll assume your question is really more like "Is food with a label of organic certification better for my body than less expensive, 'regular' food."
There have been studies on this topic and the short answer is yes, there is some evidence that organic foods have lower residual pesticide levels, and I believe they've shown higher nutrient levels, on average, as well.
If you prefer the taste of the organic options, that's immediate feedback and you can personally judge the value.
Here are the few benefits of organic food products listed below - More Nutrients- Study found that organic fruit and vegetables have up to 50% more antioxidants, which can cut the risk of cancer and heart disease.
On inquiry, I found out that she had purchased and used conventional milk that day, as compared to the organic milk that we usually use.
If you take an organic carrot that was picked and packed and stored in the same way as a non-organic carrot, which is generally going to be the case for all food found in the grocery store, you will not likely discern a difference.
The organic carrot is demonstrably a good choice if you care about the environment and probably a better choice if you seek to minimize what artificial chemicals you ingest, but both are industrially grown.
Unfortunately, "Organic" has been co-opted as a marketing term by large corporations and their industrialized production, and so that means that the drop in nutrient content applies to organic and "conventional" alike.
Milk is ultra pasteurized meaning it has a longer unopened shelf life, but I haven't noticed a taste difference with milk either.
The biggest difference is the price.
The price may be a bit inflated, but if it is truly organic and done right, then you truly can taste the difference.
The environmental effects notwithstanding, as a food, it has to be better for you too because of the lack of chemicals.
Nobody has ever argued that more chemicals are good for you.
Fresh locally grown produce (regardless of whether it's conventional, organic, or GMO) will almost always be superior in flavor.
Organic tea means that it is grown without the use of any chemically produced pesticides, fertilisers.
Not just healthier to drink, organically farmed tea also removes harmful chemical runoff from the environment and is much healthier for the farm workers and their families, who are not exposed to these harmful chemicals in the first place.
Meanwhile, this also depends on your own preference, some organic teas I’ve tasted are quite delicious too.
As far as I can see this is the only tangible benefit of organic food.
Those promoting organic food would suggest the nutrient content of organic food far surpasses conventional farmed food.
An unripe tomato plucked while green and shipped 5000 miles will lack the sweetness and vitamin c of a tomato allowed to ripen in the ground, organic or not.
In season I can travel to a dozen farmer's markets, roadside stands and people's homes to buy fresh organic fruits, veggies, honey and eggs.
It is, as other answers have pointed out, a debatable point as to whether organic food really does taste particularly delicious.
For example, a study in Nutrition and Food Science ( Page on emeraldinsight.com ) found that when blinded, organic juice tasted better, but organic milk did not taste better than non-organic milk.
It's conclusion was that "the global claim that “organic food tastes better” is not valid, and each product type should be treated separately before a claim can be made."
Furthermore, blind taste tests on tomatoes have found them to taste worse if organically grown, and potato and broccoli to be indistinguishable in taste quality ( Organic food less tasty than normal, watchdog says ).
Even Stephanie Zonis, who seems to be generally pro-organic, in a non-blinded taste test, says the results are mixed ( Page on thenibble.com ) and concluding: "I cannot state definitively that organically produced or raised foods taste better (or worse) than their conventionally-produced counterparts.
The reason you think they are "so delicious" is quite possibly due to the halo effect, which those working in marketing understand very well.
And a study has been done into that, too: ( You taste what you see: Do organic labels bias taste perceptions?
For two foods (yogurt and potato chips) they clearly preferred the organic food taste.
I feel safe in the knowledge that the locally sourced, organic food I consume is genuinely endorsed by the Soil Association.
While a lot of people are willing to pay the extra cost for organic food, because they have a strong belief that organic foods are safer, tastier, healthier, and environmentally beneficial – there are several ways in which you can avoid paying high prices for organic foods.
The best place to start is the Organic Consumer Organization website, but here are some tips and suggestions for buying organic more economically.
First of all and the biggest way to save in my opinion, is always buy organic fruit and vegetables when they are in season.
You can also save quite a bit of money buying these in bulk.
You don't want to buy all those delicious organic food only to have it spoil do to improper storage.
Check the organic farms in your state and locate organic farmer’s markets, which have fresh products on a daily basis.
You can also grow your own organic produce.
Check with your local gardening supply store to find out how to begin an organic garden, and the supplies needed.
Buy organic food online.
Many of the products are organic, and much of the produce comes from local family farms.
typically, vendors selling everything from organic vegetables to humanely raised beef and poultry bring their wares.
I hope organic food becomes cheaper and more easily accessible to everyone and the chemicals and pesticides used for growing what's being called "food" someday are stopped.
They provide fresh, organic fruits and veggies to your doorstep.
;) It's a company that works with all the organic farmers in Vegas and southern California so it's all local!
(Meaning better for environment because of a smaller carbon footprint)They have been around for 5+ years and are constantly growing in the Vegas area so it'd be a great company to partner with because they're becoming very well-known.
It is mostly all marketing.
Buy of very small producers if you want an organic kick.
Try your local allotments there are always allotment holders who grow and produce more than they can consume.
And in fact it has been proven time and again that many organic foods are not actually better for you as the supposed natural ways of producing can also sometimes aha negative side affects, damage the dna, etc.
Very few organic foods exist in their native state as they have been grafted and recommend for eons.
Not to say I don't buy organic, but more important to me is to to buy local and to buy fresh untreated foods even from natural or supposed organic methods.
I'm more concerned with the taste than the politics.
I usually buy my fruits and vegetables at Farmer's Markets where everything is grown locally and therefore is very fresh and ripe.
Not all this produce is grown organically but it is all much better than store bought.
I also always buy organic beef, milk and eggs, whether at the Farmer's Market or at stores like Whole Foods.
As far as taste, of everything but the beef, I don't see the difference if everything else is equal.
And, even though I'll only eat organic beef, I don't think it's as tasty as the commercial beef because grass-fed cattle graze, and because of that are leaner with less marbling in their muscles.
So, in my opinion, eat organic for health reasons, not for the taste.
There is no difference in normal eggs and so called packaged organic eggs.
It is just the packaging and with fancy marketing tag.
It is also costly when compared to loose eggs .
The same argument can be made for “local” which also may or may not have more/less of an environmental impact.
The demand is increasing day by day.
So they are looking organic products as a alternative.
People find organic products way more costly than the normal ones.
If you can sell them at normal rates customer response will be good.
Hi...if you are looking for quality organic food i would like to suggest you that you can order from a renowned agro product merchandiser Sun Impex BV.
You may be able to recognize organic produce by the fact that it tends to be smaller in size, and may not be blemish-free - but that definitely, absolutely doesn't not automatically make it inferior.
It is very easy to show that organic food is smaller, takes up more land to produce, uses a lot more pesticides and has way less vitamins and minerals, all you have to look at is the ingredients, I have seen organic posters even claim that organic foods contain vitamins that it does not contain at all and you can see it when you look at the ingredients on the product.
Organic is worse for the environment, and has no nutritional advantage.
Organic produce is having unlimited benefits.
How about omega3:omega6 ratios in organic vs conventional animals?
The 'local and organic' tag needs to be dropped if we need to head in the right direction.
Organic rules that prohibit certain food preservatives can therefore make organic food less healthy.
So there is no evidence that organic food is better or worse for you than a varied diet of conventionally-grown stuff.
The only reason why I eat organic food is to limit the chemicals that get inside my body.
When it comes to produce - organic means grown without the use of pesticides (“pesticides” here being a broad term that actually includes fungicides, herbicides, etc.).
This means better quality meat and, more importantly, better quality fat.
Organic is what normal food should have been all along.
Is organic food really good for you?
Fruit you buy at the grocery store is not "processed" (whatever that means exactly).
But I agree that there is a correlation between use of organic ingredients and reduced food processing, simply because producers often choose to do both of those things concurrently to maximize appeal to health-conscious consumers.
Although it's certainly possible -- fresh apples keep exceptionally well (literally for years) if refrigerated in a nitrogen-purge atmosphere.
If you're passionate about that, then you need to buy everything organic.
Of course, there may be cases where buying certified organic is, on balance, more environmentally destructive because of food miles and other energy-related issues.
If you're choosing between a non-organic product with low food miles and an organic product with high food miles, organic might be a worse choice.
On the other hand, buying organic helps build the market for organic products, so perhaps more options will exist in the future.
You may have to shell out a bit more, but at least you can breath easy on the much higher hospital bills that might have been the case.
I always go for BC or New Zealand apples (I live in Vancouver), without bothering about organic or not except as it affects the price.
If there’s no choice and I have to buy US apples and other produce, I go for organic ones.
There are good reasons for those bans: those particular pesticides are not safe for humans and also damage the environment, especially bees.
So for safety’s sake and also for the bees’ sake, US organic apples are safer and healthier than regular US apples, even though they do cost more, while BC “inorganic” apples (if there were such a thing as an inorganic apple I would like to see it.
But not to eat it, I think) are also safe for humans and bees and there’s no point in paying extra for organic ones.
