If you do, then spend the money if you have it.
Let me tell you first why Organic Food is expensive?
Organic food supply is limited as compared to demand; Production costs for organic foods are typically higher because of greater labour inputs per unit of output Post-harvest handling of relatively small quantities of organic foods results in higher costs because of the mandatory segregation of organic and conventional produce, especially for processing and transportation; Marketing and the distribution chain for organic products is relatively inefficient and costs are higher because of relatively small volumes.
In order to trust the Organic Brand you should check the norms (international and national)- like NPOP, USDA, etc - which have set the standards and which conform to these guidelines and certify producers.
Many vegitarians and vegans could probably list many books and websites that explain and show all the horrific things that take place in these factories(these places are not farms) that mass produce beef, pork, chicken etc., but I am neither and will just compare it will organic animal husbandry practices.
Organic celery is a nice deep (almost electric) Green because it's gotten lots of sun which stimulates chlorophyll growth, and thus the flavor you and I like.
Also, the opposite of “organic” in the context it is typically used is “conventional”, not “GMO”.
If you are only interested in the health benefits for you, then it really depends, and is not something that can be answered without a LOT of additional information.
The information I already asked about, but also things like how much money a certain increase in “health” (and what aspects of “health” you are talking about; “health” is a lot of different things all working together) is worth to you.
Very (VERY) simplistically, would one less sick day per lifetime and one more day alive be worth $1,000,000,000,000?
A relatively recent meta study (a study aggregating the results of several different studies) found no benefit: Little evidence of health benefits from organic foods, Stanford study finds .
There is decent evidence to suggest it is no better for your health and actually worse for the environment.
Additionally, a very large meta study conducted at Stanford found no health benefits to organic food.
But local and organic food are not synonymous.
Likewise I can get food labelled organic that is flown in from across the world.
The foods are proven no more safe and overall are likely worse for the environment.
But again, this isn't about organic but rather about heirloom foods (organic does not mean heirloom varieties).
would mean "Certified Organic" under some public authority.. To be certified it would be cultivated under certain rules and perhap from an inspected farm.
And then there are families or companies whose property is legally Certified Organic and they can sell a certified organic Main Wild Blueberry that you could also say was "Wildcrafted"
Organic foods refer to food items that are grown without the use of chemicals, fertilizers or any unnatural interference.
"Natural" or "organic" pesticides (organic growers all use pesticides, they just use organic ones) can be just as safe/harmless as synthetic ones.
Whether the pesticide was organic or not would not matter.
If you are a grower, look at the labels on the pesticide and decide for yourself if it is toxic or not, but pay no heed to buzzwords like "natural," "organic," or "synthetic" that have no bearing on safety of efficacy, period.
Organic Standards are massively different in different countries.

The variations between organic and traditional foods stem directly from the farming ways that were used throughout the food’s production.
India may account for 1 - 2% of the total organic produce worldwide.
Around 60 per cent of the country’s organic products were exported to the European Union, 20 per cent to the US, 5 per cent to Japan and the rest to Canada, Australia and East Asian countries. "
Few years ago, I read that organic tender coconut was priced at Rs.200 ($5 then), in an export market.
So I would say, the price factor for Indian organic produce is highly influenced by the lucrative global market, rather than anything else.
If more and more people switch to organic farming then price might come down coz of the lower demand which will lead to abandoning organic farming again.
Kalgudi - Helping everyone across the globe with agricultural information You might think organic food would cost less than conventional food since the production is spared the cost of the chemicals, synthetic pesticides, and antibiotics.
Post-harvest handling cost In order to avoid cross-contamination, organic produce must be separated from conventional produce after being harvested.
Egg color only depends on the breed of chicken, not whether the egg is organic.
Dr. Benbrook’s research has established that organically grown vegetables and fruits contain higher levels of nutrients than their conventional counterparts.
In 145 of the 236 matched pairs (61%), the organic foods were more nutrient dense.
Nutrient levels were on average 31% or more higher in organic foods than conventional in 25% of the study samples.
Across all 236 matched pairs and 11 nutrients, the nutritional premium of the organic food averaged 25%.
Antioxidants Numerous studies have found higher levels of antioxidants in organic produce than in conventional.
Organic tomatoes contained 79% and 97% higher levels of quercetin and kaempferol, respectively, in a long-term study conducted at the University of California – Davis (Mitchell AE et al., 2007).

Can't be made in bulk, so costs go up.
To answer how organic food can be made cheap?
And finally, I'll build off what Bruce Ames has to say about all the worries about chemicals (and organic food).
We're eating natural pesticides, which are natural chemicals that plants use to try to kill off insects that try to eat them.
And we eat roughly 1,500 milligrams of them per day.
We eat 0.09 milligrams of synthetic pesticide residues.
So we're talking about incredibly tiny amounts of synthetic pesticides, and yet the same percentage of natural chemicals come out positive.
Studies show there is no significant different in the nutritional value of organic food compared to non-organic.
Many organic dairy products available in the market are either UHT or treated some how to ensure longer shelf life.

Unfortunately, I learned that this new testing program is only there to encourage compliance with the organic rules, not to document anything about relative residue levels.
Meanwhile, what would be best for the environment were to only choose to buy organic for those crops where yield is not much lower (lower yields = more wasted resources), or even higher than conventional.
There is zero health or nutritional benefit to be gained by spending twice what you need to on organic.
Organic Tomatoes According to a 10-year study conducted by the University of California, Davis, organic tomatoes are produced in an environment that has a lower nutrient supply since nitrogen-rich chemical fertilizers are not added.

The good reasons revolve around trying to grow the plant in an environment close to the one it evolved in.
And it involves a lot of human labor, not easily mechanized, because mechanization works best in monocultures and the whole point is to avoid monoculture.
The rest of "organic", as a USDA certified label, is the bad reasons.
Which, to get back to the point of the question, means taking those "natural" pesticides, concentrating them, and applying them to vast monocultures.
You do need to get over your fear of "chemicals" because it's ALL chemicals.
